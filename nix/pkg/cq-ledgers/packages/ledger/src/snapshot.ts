/**
 * Cross-ledger snapshot (T143, Q75).
 *
 * A GENERIC, flow-agnostic, compact view of every ACTIVE (non-archived) item
 * across every active ledger, grouped by ledger then by status. Each item is
 * reduced to the `{ id, status, summary }` stub — NO long narrative fields —
 * so the whole snapshot stays well under the token-overflow threshold that a
 * full per-ledger `fetch_ledger` sweep hits.
 *
 * This module is intentionally free of DAG / phase / predicate semantics:
 * those stay in the flow prompts. It is a pure projection over the
 * already-resolved `FetchedLedger` views (which themselves only carry active
 * items — archived items live in the archive files, not in `milestones[]`),
 * so it builds cleanly on the store's existing `enumerate()` + `fetch()`.
