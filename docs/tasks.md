PRESERVE the existing pinning mechanism VERBATIM (R389/minimax — name it, don't just 'keep'): `.lw-help` is a `display:flex; flex-direction:column` box; `.lw-help-head` (the tab strip) is the non-growing pinned header (flex-shrink:0 / does not scroll); `.lw-help-body` is `flex:1; min-height:0; overflow-y:auto` (the SINGLE internal scroller). The only change is the `.lw-help` size (drop the min(...,720px)/min(900px,92vw) caps → 90vw/90vh); the flex column + head-pin + body-scroll structure is unchanged so the diagram-heavy tabs get the full 90vh of scroll room and the tab strip never scrolls out of view.

Change the `unavailable` cell to a clearly stale-server-distinct message, verbatim-ish: 'model overlay unavailable — server predates get_agent_models; rebuild + restart ledger-web/ledger-mcp'.

- description: "Per Q179 (clickable nodes) + Q181 (roleKind color), the shared renderer/data foundation for FU-4. (1) diagramLayout.ts: widen `DiagramNode` (and the laid-out node) with optional `agentId?: string`, preserved through `layoutDiagram` exactly as `fill` is. (2) roleActions.ts: widen `RoleNode` with optional `agentId?: string`. **TYPE (R390/opus): EXTRACT the currently-INLINE `RoleNode.roleKind` union (orchestrator/planner/reviewer/worker/conflict-resolver/explore/user/external) into a single EXPORTED named `RoleKind` type, and WIDEN it with the infra kinds needed by T327's infra nodes (worktree/main/ledger). Then define + EXPORT `ROLE_KIND_FILL: Record<RoleKind, string>` (one distinct hue per RoleKind, keyed exactly on the named type) and a `fillForRoleKind(kind: RoleKind)` helper.** So the palette, T327's per-node roleKind assignments, and T329's legend all reference ONE named type the type-checker (`bun run check`) enforces. (3) DiagramSvg.tsx: add an optional `onActivateAgent?: (agentId: string) => void` prop; render any node carrying `agentId` as activatable (`cursor:pointer`, `role=\"button\"`, `tabIndex={0}`, onClick + onKeyDown Enter/Space → onActivateAgent(agentId)); nodes WITHOUT agentId stay static/non-interactive. **FILL (LOCKED Q181 'no renderer change'): DiagramSvg fill resolution stays EXACTLY `n.fill ?? DEFAULT_FILL` — do NOT add fillForRoleKind into the renderer (LaidOutNode does not carry roleKind). ROLE_KIND_FILL + fillForRoleKind are roleActions.ts HELPERS that T327 uses to author `node.fill`; the renderer just honors that authored fill.** Keep the per-index edge key (T316) + existing static rendering for non-agentId nodes. This task ships the type+palette-helper+renderer affordance ONLY, tested with a synthetic model (no ROLE_FLOWS value authoring — that is T327). OWNS its tests."

DEFAULT_FILL` UNCHANGED, no roleKind in renderer); (d) `layoutDiagram` round-trips `agentId`. Type/unit test: `RoleKind` is an exported named type INCLUDING the infra kinds (worktree/main/ledger); `ROLE_KIND_FILL` is `Record<RoleKind,string>` with one distinct hex per RoleKind value (exhaustive over the named type) and `fillForRoleKind` is referentially stable. `bun run check` (from nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/) green; `nix build .#ledger-web` exit 0."

(a) AGENTID MAP — set `agentId` on the role node representing each concrete dispatched subagent, VERBATIM map: plan flow: planner→`plan-advance`, reviewer→`plan-reviewer`; implement flow: worker→`implement-worker`, reviewer→`implement-reviewer`, conflict-resolver→`implement-conflict-resolver` (add a conflict-resolver node if absent); investigate flow: explorer→`investigate-explorer`, prober→`investigate-prober` (add a prober node if absent); advance flow: link its lane nodes to the sub-flow command ids where sensible. Abstract nodes (user/main/worktree/ledger/flow-lane) get NO agentId. AGENT_ROLES is imported into roleActions.ts from `./agentsCatalogue` (the node-free re-export of agentsCatalogue.gen.ts AGENT_ROLES); every authored agentId MUST be an id present in AGENT_ROLES. (b) FORMALIZED OPS (Q180 verbatim: 'if the flow says a particular agent performs a merge or dispatches a subagent of a particular type — it should be visible') — surface EVERY op formalized in the cq-assets flow prompts as a first-class labeled edge + infra node, GROUNDED by reading nix/pkg/cq-assets/commands/cq/plan/advance.md, .../investigate/advance.md, .../implement/advance.md, the top-level .../advance.md, and agents/*.md.

Add infra nodes (worktree, main, ledger) where a flow touches them. Do NOT invent ops the prompts don't formalize. New edges use the SAME deterministic per-index keying as T316/T326 (no unstable keys). (c) set `roleKind` on every node and `fill` = `fillForRoleKind(roleKind)` (the T326 helper) on every node — authored on node.fill in THIS file (the renderer just honors n.fill). dependsOn T326 (widened types + palette helper).
