- headline: Show per-ledger item count in the ledgers list (right-aligned), TUI + web
- description: "DONE. enumerate_ledgers (both the Claude-side factory and the stdio variant) now additively returns a `counts` map alongside `ledgers` (active-item count per ledger; existing `.ledgers` consumers untouched). Added LedgerSummary {name,itemCount} to @cq/ledger types; LedgerClient.enumerateLedgers() now returns LedgerSummary[] in both frontends. TUI sidebar: ScrollList renderLabel pads the name so the dim count sits flush-right (accounts for cursor prefix + scrollbar). Web sidebar: each ledger button is flex space-between with a .lw-ledger-name span and a right-aligned dim .lw-ledger-count span (data-testid ledger-count-<name>). Updated all fakes + the mcpClient assertion; added render tests in both UIs. bun run check: 371 pass, typecheck + lint clean."

- description: "DONE. Data-driven gate canAnswer(schema,status) in both status.ts: schema has `answer` field AND `answered` reachable from current status. Web DetailPanel: answer textarea + 'save & mark answered' button (writes answer + transitions in one updateItem); the bare `answered` quick-transition is replaced by the box, `withdrawn` stays. Plus a second 'as recommended' button (shown when a non-empty `recommendation` field exists) that writes the literal string 'as recommended' and marks answered. TUI: `a` opens a prefilled answer prompt (save+transition); `r` answers 'as recommended' in one key when a recommendation exists; hints advertise both. Constants ANSWER_FIELD/ANSWERED_STATUS/RECOMMENDATION_FIELD/AS_RECOMMENDED_ANSWER shared in status.ts. Added a `questions` ledger to both fakes + 4 tests. NOTE: 'as recommended' writes the literal phrase per the request's wording; flagged to user as a choice vs copying the recommendation text."

On connect, capture the saved view synchronously before the reset clears it, then after enumerate re-open the saved ledger, re-select the saved item, and re-enter graph mode (loadDagData) if it was active; silently skipped when the saved ledger/item no longer exists. Added localStorage.clear() to both web test files' beforeEach for isolation (a leak otherwise auto-restored across tests — caught a dagView regression). 4 new tests (persist + restore table + restore graph). bun run check: 379 pass, typecheck + lint clean."

- headline: Extract a reusable embedded ledger-MCP server module (handler + WS hub + watcher)
- description: |
    Foundation for in-process UIs (BLOCKS T18, T20). Refactor packages/ledger-mcp/src/main.ts so the request handler, WS pub/sub hub, and startLedgerWatcher wiring become reusable factories rather than being inlined in serveHttp()/main(). Proposed surface (e.g. in @cq/ledger-mcp index or a new embedded.ts):
    - buildServer(store) [already exists — export it]
    - createEmbeddedStore(cwd): new FsLedgerStore({root})+init
    - attachMcpHttp(store): { handle(req): Promise<Response>, onWsOpen(ws), onWsMessage(ws,raw) } so any Bun.serve (standalone binary OR ledger-web) mounts the same /mcp + /ws logic; the watcher's onChange calls server.publish(LEDGER_TOPIC, changedFrame(ledger)).
    Refactor main.ts to consume these — NO behavior change; all existing ledger-mcp tests stay green. Verify: bun test packages/ledger-mcp + packages/ledger.

    DEPENDS ON T17. Add McpLedgerClient.embedded(cwd) (or a small factory) that: createEmbeddedStore(cwd) → buildServer(store) → InMemoryTransport.createLinkedPair() → server.connect(serverT) + new Client().connect(clientT) → new McpLedgerClient(client). main.tsx: when --mcp-url is omitted, run embedded; when provided, keep today's HTTP connect.
    
    RESOLVED (Q9): rename the TUI flag --url → --mcp-url and DROP --url (no alias). RESOLVED (Q10): embedded ledger-root precedence --cwd > $LEDGER_ROOT > process.cwd() (mirrors ledger-mcp). Lifecycle: on exit close client, dispose store, close watcher. Live updates handled in T19.

Plan: App takes an optional change-source/onSubscribe(refresh) prop; in embedded mode wire startLedgerWatcher(store, cwd, () => refreshRef.current()) so external edits (the agent's stdio server, git, a second UI) refresh the view; self-edits already refetch post-mutation. The LiveBadge (connecting/alive/stale) is meaningless without a socket — hide it (or show a static 'in-process' indicator) when embedded. Verify the watcher triggers a refetch on a file write."

    RESOLVED (Q10): embedded root precedence --cwd > $LEDGER_ROOT > process.cwd(); default when neither flag given = embedded at that root. --host/--port unchanged.

(2) Web: spin serve({cwd: tmpRoot}) with NO --mcp-url, connect a real MCP client to /mcp end-to-end (create+fetch), and assert a /ws 'changed' frame arrives after an out-of-band file write to docs/. (3) Update ledger-tui/ledger-web parseArgs tests for the new flag/cwd semantics. Verify: bun run check stays green."

Clarify the CLAUDE.md invariant: 'frontends are pure MCP clients — never read ledger files directly' STILL holds; embedded mode co-locates the MCP server in-process (in-memory transport for TUI, co-hosted HTTP for web), it does not make the UI read files. Verify the Nix products (nix build .#ledger-tui / .#ledger-web) run standalone; refresh the FOD hash only if deps changed."

- description: |
    Minor/cosmetic. Independent of the embedded-mode work (T17–T22). In both detail views, when the item is a question (data-driven gate: schema declares a `question` field), render fields in this fixed order instead of the generic orderItemFields (short-first): 1) short/metadata fields first (e.g. ledgerRefs/tags and other compact fields), then 2) question, 3) context, 4) recommendation — visually HIGHLIGHTED, 5) answer.
    
    Highlight the recommendation: web = a distinct styled block (e.g. .lw-recommendation accent border/background) on the recommendation dd; TUI ContentPane = a colored/bold block. Preserve the existing answer affordance from T2: for an answerable (open) question the editable answer box stays, sitting just BELOW the highlighted recommendation; for an answered/terminal question the answer renders as the final field. Touch web DetailPanel (App.tsx) and TUI ContentPane (app.tsx); add a small ordering/highlight constant alongside the ANSWER_FIELD/RECOMMENDATION_FIELD constants in status.ts. Tests: web asserts the recommendation carries the highlight class and that question precedes context precedes recommendation precedes answer in DOM order.

- suggestedModel: frontier
- description: |
    Foundational design task. Lock the conventions every other task depends on:
    
    1. PORTABLE MODEL LABELS (Q3/Q4). `tasks.suggestedModel` already exists in the schema. Define a small portable tier vocabulary (e.g. `frontier` = most capable, `standard` = mid, `fast` = cheap) and a per-host mapping: Claude -> opus/sonnet/haiku; Codex -> its model tiers (e.g. gpt-5.x top / mid). The orchestrator resolves a task's label to the host tool's concrete model. If `suggestedModel` is unset -> default to the orchestrator's OWN class and emit a WARNING.
    2. REVIEWER 'most capable' resolves per host: Claude -> opus; Codex -> its top tier.
    3. WORKTREE STRATEGY (Q1). Native `isolation: worktree` is a Claude-Code-only subagent feature. Codex has no equivalent declarative subagent-worktree mechanism, so under Codex the orchestrator must run manual `git worktree add/remove`. Specify the branch in the advance command body: native isolation under Claude, manual git worktree under Codex.
- acceptance: "A `decisions` item is created and locked capturing: the tier vocabulary + per-host model map, the reviewer capability resolution, and the dual worktree strategy (Claude native / Codex manual). The mapping is concrete enough that the advance command can implement it without further questions."

    The core loop, living in the main session (subagents cannot spawn subagents). Per round:
    1. READY-SET: scan target milestones; a task is ready iff not terminal, not `blocked`, all `dependsOn` are `done`, its milestone's deps are satisfied, and it has no linked `open` question. Also flip `blocked`->`planned` for tasks whose blocking question is now `answered` (Q7 resume).
    2. DISPATCH up to N concurrent implement-worker subagents (N configurable, default 4 — Q2), each in a worktree (Claude native isolation / Codex manual — per T4), at the task's resolved model (warn if suggestedModel unset — Q4).
    3. REVIEW each finished worker with implement-reviewer at the most-capable model.
    4. AUTONOMOUS CRITICISM LOOP (Q5): NO fixed cap. Feed criticism back to the worker in the same worktree, re-review, repeat. The orchestrator validates worker/reviewer output for sanity and detects ILL LOOPS — stop and register a question when: a round yields no file changes; the diff/criticism repeats without shrinking across rounds; the same check failure recurs. Keep a high absolute safety ceiling as defense-in-depth even though there is no normal cap.
    5. QUESTIONS: reviewer questions OR ill-loop bailout -> create `questions` items linked `tasks:<id>`, set task `blocked`. User answers in TUI/web then runs /implement:advance to resume.
    6. SUCCESS GATE (Q8): success = `bun run check` green AND reviewer approval.
    7. MERGE-BACK (Q6): sequential in dependency order; rebase each remaining worktree on the updated base; on conflict dispatch implement-conflict-resolver; on success set task `done` + record resultCommit/completion. Loop until no ready tasks remain; report done / blocked / failed.

- suggestedModel: frontier
- description: |
    Every subagent we dispatch (BOTH /plan:* and /implement:* flows) must produce a brief session summary on handover: what it did, what it achieved, what it discovered, any issues/blockers/observations.
    
    RESOLVED (see decision D-log): the subagent does NOT write a file. It RETURNS the summary as a clearly-delimited section at the end of its final message; the ORCHESTRATOR writes ./docs/logs/<timestamp>-<agent-id>.md from that returned summary. The orchestrator takes <agent-id> from the Agent tool result and stamps <timestamp> itself. This keeps subagents read-only (no Write needed; T13 denylist unchanged), avoids worktree-log-merge issues, and is concurrency-safe (one writer, unique filenames).
    
    Scope of the change:
    1. Subagent BODIES (plan-advance, plan-reviewer, implement-worker, implement-reviewer, implement-conflict-resolver): add an explicit 'Session summary' output section to each Output contract (did / achieved / discovered / issues).
    2. ORCHESTRATOR commands (plan/advance, plan/start, implement/advance, implement/start): after each spawned subagent returns, write ./docs/logs/<timestamp>-<agent-id>.md from its returned summary.
    3. Ensure ./docs/logs/ exists (add .gitkeep or create on write). docs/*.md ledger files are unaffected (different directory).
    4. Document the convention in llm/README.md and .codex/prompts/README.md.
- acceptance: All five subagent bodies emit a 'Session summary' section in their final message. All four orchestrator commands write ./docs/logs/<timestamp>-<agent-id>.md from the returned summary. Subagents need NO Write tool (T13 denylist unchanged). Convention documented in both READMEs.

- headline: Fix plan-flow subagent MCP tool access (server-name independent)
- suggestedModel: standard
- description: |
    DEFECT: plan-advance/plan-reviewer declared `tools: mcp__ledger__*` (an exact-name allowlist). When the ledger MCP server is exposed under a different name (e.g. the home-manager plugin's `mcp__plugin_claude-code-home-manager_ledger__*` instead of the repo .mcp.json `ledger`), the allowlist matches nothing and the subagents get ZERO ledger tools, so they cannot write. Reproduced: a spawned plan-advance reported it had no ledger tools and could not persist questions. Docs confirm there is no cross-server `mcp__*` wildcard, and that subagents inherit all MCP tools by default unless a `tools:` allowlist restricts them.
    
    FIX (done): replaced the `tools:` allowlist in both llm/agents/plan-advance.md and llm/agents/plan-reviewer.md with `disallowedTools: Write, Edit, MultiEdit, NotebookEdit, Bash`. This inherits ALL MCP servers regardless of name while preserving each agent's read-only-on-repo posture. Ran `bun run link-prompts` to materialise .claude/agents symlinks (project agents override the plugin copies).
- acceptance: VERIFIED at the mechanism level (subagent reaches plugin ledger with no allowlist). Live end-to-end on the named plan agents pending a session restart / plugin rebuild. Both plan agents use a denylist, not an MCP-name allowlist.
- ledgerRefs: ["goals:G1"]
- completion: |
    Source fix complete + mechanism verified; live activation needs a session restart.
    
    EVIDENCE: (1) A general-purpose subagent (no tools allowlist) successfully loaded and called mcp__plugin_claude-code-home-manager_ledger__fetch_item from inside a subagent -> subagents DO inherit the plugin-namespaced ledger server; the denylist approach is sound. (2) The bare mcp__ledger__* server does not exist in this environment. (3) A spawned plan-reviewer still failed (only Read/Grep/Glob/Web) -> it ran the PLUGIN's bundled copy (mcp__ledger__* allowlist), not my edited .claude/agents symlink.
    
    ROOT OF THE LIVE MISS: the agent registry loads at session start; the .claude/agents symlinks were created mid-session by link-prompts, so the registry still holds the plugin copy. Docs: subagent precedence is Project > User > Plugin, so after a RESTART the project symlinks (-> fixed llm/) override the plugin.
    
    TO ACTIVATE: (a) restart the Claude session (project .claude/agents override the plugin) for the local fix; (b) for users who get these agents via the home-manager plugin, rebuild the plugin from this repo's updated llm/ (llmAssets) so the bundled copies carry the denylist. NOTE: uncommitted working-tree change in llm/agents/plan-advance.md and llm/agents/plan-reviewer.md.

- headline: "/plan:advance with no args advances all unlocked goals"
- suggestedModel: frontier
- description: "Currently /plan:advance requires a goal id ($ARGUMENTS). Improvement: when called WITHOUT arguments, it should advance ALL 'unlocked' goals — i.e. every goal not in a terminal/locked phase. Define 'unlocked' precisely: goals in `clarifying` or `planning` (not `planned`, `done`, or `abandoned`). For each such goal, run the existing planner<->reviewer round (the same per-goal loop). Iterate goals independently; a goal that hits `awaiting-answers` is reported and skipped, others continue. Update llm/commands/plan/advance.md: when $ARGUMENTS is empty, enumerate goals via the goals ledger and loop over the unlocked set; when an id is given, keep current single-goal behaviour. Report a per-goal summary (phase + next action) at the end."
- acceptance: advance.md handles empty $ARGUMENTS by selecting all goals in clarifying/planning and running the round on each; explicit-id behaviour unchanged. The 4-iteration cap applies per goal. Per-goal outcome summary is reported.

- suggestedModel: frontier
- description: |
    User request: a command to add more scope to an EXISTING goal once its plan is done. Decisions (asked + answered): re-open the SAME goal via a schema change; clarify-first.
    
    Constraint found in code: GOALS_SCHEMA forbids leaving terminal states, and validateSchema enforces 'a terminal status must have no outgoing transitions' (core.ts:177). So done/abandoned cannot gain a ->planning edge without dropping them from terminalStatuses (which regresses milestone archiving + the meaning of done). The plan-flow/implement-flow only ever drive a goal to `planned` or `building` (both non-terminal), so re-open from those covers every reachable state incl. G1 (currently planned).
    
    Scope:
    1. @cq/ledger: add `planned->planning` and `building->planning` to GOALS_SCHEMA.transitions (constants.ts). Leave done/abandoned terminal+empty. Update the comment.
    2. Tests (repro-first): transitions.test.ts behavioral re-open (planned->planning, building->planning) over both adapters + pinned-edge assertions.
    3. New asset llm/commands/plan/follow-up.md: thin, mirrors plan/start.md. Validate goal exists & is non-terminal; append the follow-up request to the goal description (preserve history); re-open planned/building -> planning -> clarifying; hand to plan-advance (clarify-first); write session log; report. Terminal goal -> refuse with guidance.
    4. Wire: link-prompts.ts LINKS + .codex/prompts/plan-follow-up.md symlink + both README tables (+ How-Codex list).
    5. bun run check green.
- ledgerRefs: ["goals:G1"]
- completion: "Done. (1) GOALS_SCHEMA gained planned->planning + building->planning re-open edges (constants.ts); docs/ledgers.yaml regenerated. (2) transitions.test.ts: behavioral re-open tests over both adapters + pinned-edge assertions (repro-first: confirmed 5 failures pre-change, all green after). (3) llm/commands/plan/follow-up.md created (parse id+request, phase-gate terminal goals, append request to description, re-open ->planning->clarifying, hand to plan-advance, write session log, report). (4) Wired: link-prompts.ts, .codex/prompts/plan-follow-up.md symlink, both README tables + How-Codex list + ledger-ref; plan-advance.md transitions note updated. bun run check green (384 pass). RESTART CAVEAT: the running ledger MCP server loaded the OLD schema at session start, so planned->planning is rejected until it restarts (same registry-load-at-start limitation as T13); docs/ledgers.yaml is already correct for the next boot."
