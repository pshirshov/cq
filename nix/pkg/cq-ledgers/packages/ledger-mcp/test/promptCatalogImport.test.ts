/**
 * T341 — the node-free typed prompt catalog is importable by ledger-mcp DIRECTLY.
 *
 * Acceptance requires the typed catalog (in `@cq/config`) be importable by
 * ledger-mcp with no duplicate copy. ledger-mcp already declares `@cq/config` as
 * a dependency (for `loadConfig`/`AGENT_ROLE_TIERS`); this test imports the typed
 * catalog STORE from the SAME package and asserts the sidecars are usable here —
 * if the import did not resolve/compile, this test file would not typecheck or
 * run, proving importability. The validate-in/out flow (later chain tasks) lives
 * server-side, so this is exactly where importability matters.
 *
 * The schemas are PLAIN JSON Schema data (draft 2020-12); compiling them with a
 * validator is exercised in the `@cq/config` test (where Ajv is a direct dep).
 * Here we only need to prove the typed catalog RESOLVES and carries the contract
 * — so this test does NOT pull Ajv into ledger-mcp (which is not, and need not
 * be, an ledger-mcp dependency).
