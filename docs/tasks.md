- headline: Rename the State Machines tab to Item States (label + ALL internal identifiers)
- description: |
    In nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/packages/ledger-web/src/App.tsx (HelpOverlay) and styles.css, rename the 'State Machines' help tab to 'Item States' per Q146 — BOTH the visible label AND every internal identifier:
    - tab-state union member 'statemachines' -> 'item-states' (the useState<...> type + every setTab/comparison);
    - visible label text 'State machines'/'State Machines' -> 'Item States';
    - data-testid help-tab-statemachines -> help-tab-item-states, help-statemachines -> help-item-states;
    - per-ledger diagram ids/section testids help-statemachine-<ledger> -> help-item-state-<ledger> (the StateMachineDiagram component + its DiagramSvg idPrefix);
    - CSS classes lw-statemachine* (e.g. lw-help-statemachines, lw-statemachine, lw-statemachine-svg) -> lw-item-state* in App.tsx AND styles.css.
    Per Q145 the TUI has no help popup and is LEFT UNCHANGED. Surgical: do not touch the Shortcuts or Flows tabs. The internal React function name (StateMachineDiagram) may stay if convenient, but every DOM-visible id/class/testid/label moves to the item-states scheme.
- acceptance: "From nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/: (negative) `rg -n 'statemachine|State machines|State Machines' packages/ledger-web/src` returns no DOM id/class/testid/label matches; (positive) `rg -n 'item-state' packages/ledger-web/src` shows the new testids/ids/classes AND the tab-state union now contains 'item-states' AND HelpOverlay renders the renamed 'Item States' tab button (data-testid help-tab-item-states) with one diagram per ledger under help-item-state-<ledger>; `bun run typecheck` green. (Render assertions are exercised by the W1 happy-dom test T269.)"

(1) Add effort:string|null to CqToken. (2) parseCqToken: split optional trailing-LAST-':' effort, validate against inlined per-harness sets; reserve ':' in the residual model (both claude model + pi model half, mirroring T286); pin+document the unsupported-effort behavior (Q163 fail-fast vs lenient policy). (3) tokenToChildModel: pi token -> {provider,model,effort}; claude path returns null (parent fallback, effort inert). (4) EMISSION (R342 CORRECTION): pi reasoning-effort is the thinking-level SHORTHAND on the model token — child --model value becomes <provider>/<model>:<effort> — NOT a separate '--thinking' flag; append ':<effort>' to the --model arg, do NOT push '--thinking'. Confirm shorthand vs installed pi CLI. Record childEffort on DispatchDetails. claude fallback: ignore effort, no flag, no error, record inertly."

Per R342: describe the pi invocation as the '--model provider/model:<effort>' thinking-level SHORTHAND (NOT a '--thinking' flag) + the claude-inert-in-pi-extension caveat (Q163). Add >=1 pi and >=1 claude alias carrying an effort suffix to cq.toml.example. Surgical edits."

(3) update every consumer of role.model/role.modelMappings (App.tsx uses the overlay only). (4) Narrow the catalogue FRESHNESS test (agentsCatalogue.gen.test.ts — full-file byte diff + the Part-(a) `model`-field assertion): remove/replace the model-field assertion, guard ONLY static fields.
