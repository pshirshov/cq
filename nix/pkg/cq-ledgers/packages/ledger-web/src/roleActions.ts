/**
 * Hand-authored role→actions catalogue for the Flows tab (T315).
 *
 * This module mirrors {@link ./flowData.ts} in export style: a typed model
 * plus a single exported array the UI tab consumes. Where `flowData` models
 * LEDGER STATES (goals, defects, tasks) and their transitions, this module
 * models ROLES (orchestrator, planner, reviewer, worker, …) and the labeled
 * ACTIONS they exchange in each cq: flow.
 *
 * The shape is intentionally type-assignable to the same {@link DiagramModel}
 * the {@link layoutDiagram} / {@link DiagramSvg} pipeline consumes. Each
 * flow's `nodes` are roles (one box per actor) and each `edges` entry is an
 * action message from one role to another.
 *
 * Hand-authored — do NOT parse prompts or generate this file. Keep it in sync
 * with the role descriptions in `nix/pkg/cq-assets/`.
 *
 * This module is node-free / browser-bundleable: no `node:*` imports.
