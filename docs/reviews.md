Object.values(f)[0]). T27's description assumes one shared location and its acceptance only names happy-dom WEB tests. The TUI copy ALSO falls through to the long criticism string[] for legacy reviews and needs the same truncate-first-criticism fallback. Fix: scope BOTH summarize() copies in T27 (or split a TUI-summarize subtask), and add an ink-testing-library assertion that a legacy review with no summary renders a truncated single line in the TUI, not the full joined criticism. As written, Req5 is only half-delivered for the TUI.","T34 bundles an objective automated gate (bun run check) with five manual observed-vs-expected smoke checks into one mega-task; the manual halves are not independently verifiable. Where feasible, fold each request's verification into the per-task acceptance tests it already owns (T30/T31/T32/T33/T27 each name happy-dom or ink tests) and reduce T34 to the green-check gate plus any cross-cutting regression assertion, rather than a manual five-point sweep.","T26 acceptance overstates the canonical-ledgers test: that test (packages/ledger/test/canonical-ledgers.test.ts) does NOT assert an exact reviews field-SET — it exercises specific fields plus a schema-divergence guard across docs/ledgers.yaml + examples/sample-ledger + the lib constant. Adding optional summary keeps it green but is not 'verified' by it. Either add an explicit assertion that REVIEWS_SCHEMA.fields.summary exists (type string, required:false) and that all three registry copies declare it, or reword T26's acceptance to claim only divergence-guard parity, not field-set assertion."]

- criticism: ["T37 (and the T35 decision lock) under-specify the investigation->planning handoff and conflate two incompatible mechanisms. T37 acceptance says on a confirmed root cause /investigate:advance should 'HAND OFF to plan-flow ... then the standard plan-advance<->plan-reviewer cycle produces reviewed fix tasks'. But /plan:advance (llm/commands/plan/advance.md) IS itself a command whose body runs the planner<->reviewer loop by spawning plan-advance/plan-reviewer subagents; a command cannot invoke another command's loop. So 'run the cycle' resolves to EITHER (a) /investigate:advance re-implements the plan loop inline (duplicates the loop that already lives in /plan:advance, and contradicts the Q26 file-and-defer integration principle the rest of the plan adopts), OR (b) it writes rootCause/suggestedFix, creates/extends the goal, and DEFERS to the user to run /plan:advance. The plan must pick (b) explicitly (consistent with Q26 file-and-defer + resumability) and state it in both T35's locked decision and T37's acceptance; as written the executor could build either.","T37/T35 do not specify the clarify-skip for the seeded goal. Q25 hands a defect with an ALREADY-confirmed root cause to plan-flow, but /plan:start and /plan:follow-up both re-open the goal to `clarifying` and spawn plan-advance for a FRESH clarifying round (llm/commands/plan/{start,follow-up}.md). Re-clarifying a defect whose root cause is confirmed is redundant. The handoff task must state how the seeded goal enters planning without a wasted clarifying round (e.g. seed the goal description with the confirmed root cause + suggestedFix so plan-advance has nothing left to clarify, or document that the planner may skip clarification when the goal is defect-seeded). Currently neither T35 nor T37 addresses this, leaving the executor to guess.","Cross-milestone dependency on the #1 follow-up (M6) is unstated and risks a same-file conflict. T42 edits implement-reviewer.md's returned-JSON contract to add `defects[]`, and its description asserts the contract 'currently' carries 'taskId/verdict/criticism/questions/rationale, plus the `summary` from the #1 follow-up'. But M6/T28 (the task that adds `summary` to that exact JSON contract) is still `planned`, and M8 dependsOn M7 ONLY (not M6). If M8 runs before M6/T28, T42's stated premise is false and two tasks edit the same JSON block in implement-reviewer.md independently. Either add M6 (or T28) to T42/M8's dependsOn, or reword T42 so its acceptance does not presuppose the `summary` field already exists (state the defects[] addition is independent of the summary work). Same applies to T40/T28 both editing plan-reviewer.md.","T44 acceptance is not operationally verifiable, repeating the defect R3 already flagged on the old T34. Its acceptance is 'A short written audit (in the task completion / PR description) confirming the closed loop ... with any drift corrected' plus 'no contradictory routing language remains' - a subjective prose deliverable, not a checkable command/invariant. The only mechanical clause is `bun run check` green (which a markdown-only consistency task cannot actually exercise for routing correctness). Tighten the acceptance to a verifiable form: e.g. a grep-able invariant (every fix task references `defects:` in ledgerRefs; no prompt instructs implement to execute a defect directly; the `[correct]`/`[incorrect]` evidence convention string appears identically in investigate-explorer + investigate/advance), so the audit's conclusion rests on enumerable checks rather than a narrative."]

Three under-specified acceptances need tightening before build (below).","T65/T66 (#7 title seam) is under-specified about HOW the displayName reaches the client. Verified: buildServer(store) constructs `new McpServer(SERVER_INFO,{instructions})` where SERVER_INFO is a module constant {name,version} and buildServer receives only `store`, NOT cwd (packages/ledger-mcp/src/main.ts L49,L183-190); the server.ts the planner could not find does not exist (main.ts is the wiring). To surface basename(--cwd), T65 must thread `cwd` into buildServer/attachMcpHttp AND into the embedded TUI (in-memory transport) and embedded web (co-hosted /mcp) hosts that call them. The MCP Implementation/serverInfo type carries only name/version/title, so the displayName must ride in name/title or in `instructions`; T66's McpLedgerClient must read it via the SDK (client.getServerVersion()/getInstructions()). Add to T65 acceptance: cwd is threaded into buildServer and the basename rides a NAMED carrier (serverInfo.title or instructions). Add to T66: the real client reads that exact carrier (not just the fake).","T54 (#4 array-editor delimiter) defers the id[] delimiter decision to the implementer ('id[] only if it does not regress ... choose one rule and apply identically'). dependsOn/blockedBy are id[] (COMMON_REF_FIELDS) and existing multi-id entry/tests may rely on comma-splitting. The plan must DECIDE the id[] rule (lowest-risk: keep comma for id[], switch only string[] to semicolon/newline) rather than leaving 'choose one rule' inside the task - that is an unscoped decision embedded in a task.","T55 (#4 one-shot normalize) declares dependsOn:T54 but the normalize must split existing array ELEMENTS directly (each element on semicolons/newlines) to stay idempotent and independent of T54's editor-parser change; re-running update_item through a parseFieldValue that now also splits could double-process or behave inconsistently. Make T55's description explicit that it operates on stored array elements, not by re-invoking the editor parse path, so its asserted idempotence holds."]

No new defects, no out-of-scope faults. Verification detail follows.","R29 #1 RESOLVED (T65/T66, #7 title seam). Confirmed against packages/ledger-mcp/src/main.ts: buildServer(store) at L183 takes ONLY store (no cwd); SERVER_INFO={name,version} module const at L49; the referenced server.ts does not exist (main.ts is the wiring). T65 now threads cwd/displayName into buildServer and ALL four real call sites: stdio (L366), attachMcpHttp's inner buildServer (L258), embedded TUI in-memory host (packages/ledger-tui/src/mcpClient.ts L81, where embedded(cwd) already has cwd in scope), and embedded web co-hosted /mcp (packages/ledger-web/src/serve.ts via attachMcpHttp). NAMED carrier decided (serverInfo.title primary, instructions fallback) rather than left open. T66's read path is real: both McpLedgerClient classes wrap a private SDK Client, so getServerVersion() (Implementation.title) / getInstructions() are reachable, and T66 requires the client read the SAME carrier T65 wrote (not just the fake). The instructions fallback correctly hedges an SDK build that omits Implementation.title.","R29 #2 RESOLVED (T54, #4 delimiter). The id[] decision is now DECIDED in the task, not deferred: string[] splits on semicolon/newline, id[] KEEPS comma. Grounded against the identical parseFieldValue in both UIs (web App.tsx L144-149, TUI app.tsx L90-95) which today comma-split both string[] and id[]; suggestions is string[] (constants.ts L193) and dependsOn/blockedBy are id[] (COMMON_REF_FIELDS), so the split-by-type rule lands on the right fields. Lowest-risk, no id[] regression surface.","R29 #3 RESOLVED (T55, #4 normalize). dependsOn is now cleared to [] (stale [T54] removed, confirmed on the item).

Every task encodes the user's literal answer: T83/T84 (#12) implement the user's DEVIATION (Q48: 'flat list without subsections - as milestones list'), suppressing coordination subsections and rendering fields.milestones, NOT the planner's keep-grouping recommendation. T79 (#9, Q38) unifies archived groups into the collapsible-section renderer with an archived badge, default-collapsed + lazy-fetch on first expand (preserves the read-only/per-pointer fetch shipped in T32, drops the pointer-button path). T80/T81 (#10, Q40) correctly depend on the shared M12 palette (T80->T52 web BUCKET_HEX/CSS vars; T81->T51 TUI warning bucket) and reuse statusBucket+lw-status-<bucket> / statusColor with the milestones schema threaded in -- no new divergent color map. T82 (#11, Q41) is the standalone web-only colgroup CSS fix, independent of T60-T62. T85 (#13, Q49) acceptance is operationally verifiable -- instrument builder call counts and assert zero additional invocations on a pure cursor move, reproduction-first at N~500/1000 -- not 'make it faster'; its deps [T62,T81,T84] are justified, not over-coupled (all three mutate the TUI render path the useMemo keys must cover, so memoizing must land after them).

Change B (M16) is sound. Change A (M17) needs the fixes below before build. No out-of-scope/pre-existing repo defects found (no `defects` to file).","[HIGHEST RISK] T74: removing the 4-iteration cap leaves the NEW auto-investigate<->replan chain (a cross-command loop: investigate confirms -> seeds goal -> plan replans -> may surface a new defect -> investigate again) WITHOUT concrete termination predicates. T74 acceptance (c) only requires generic 'model-judged ill-loop detection' and points at implement/advance.md L119-130 -- but those three signals (no file changes; criticism repeats without shrinking; same `bun run check` failure recurs) are about a SINGLE worktree's criticism rounds and do NOT translate to the cross-command auto-investigate axis. A cap-free auto-launching loop with no operationally-pinned stop for its NEW axis is a runaway-cost hazard. Fix: T74 acceptance must enumerate concrete ill-loop predicates for the auto-investigate<->replan chain specifically (e.g. the same defect D re-confirmed across rounds with no new fix tasks emitted; investigate returns no adjudicable evidence on two consecutive rounds for the same defect; the goal is re-planned with an identical task set; a defect cycles open->investigated->replanned->open without convergence) -> STOP and file an `open` questions item. 'Remove the cap' is not a stop condition.","T74: the orchestrator's auto-investigate phase is specified to run 'AFTER the per-goal planner<->reviewer round completes', but the plan does not say what happens when the round stops on `awaiting-answers` (rule 4: reviewer new_questions sent the goal back to `clarifying`) WHILE the same review's defects[] bucket was also filed (a go-ahead OR revise review may carry defects[], per plan-reviewer.md L92-95). Does auto-investigate run when the goal is simultaneously parked on user questions? Specify the interaction: either auto-investigate still runs on filed defects (they are orthogonal to the goal's clarification, per plan-advance.md L237-242) or it is deferred. As written the executor must guess.","T73/T74 data-passing is fragile and contradicts the subagent output contract. T73 has plan-advance emit a 'Filed defects for auto-investigate: D<n>' line inside its free-text `### Session summary`, and T74 parses it. But plan-advance.md L257-263 fixes the subagent's machine-readable output to a SINGLE status token on the last line; the Session summary is free prose. String-parsing a prose summary line is brittle. T74 already names the robust alternative ('open defects newly linked goals:<G> with no terminal status') -- make the LEDGER QUERY the primary (authoritative) source of the auto-investigate worklist and demote the summary flag to at most an advisory hint. Adjust T73 acceptance accordingly so it does not mandate a parse-dependent contract.","T72: the new superseding decision should state explicitly that it stands on K8 point 4 (defect-seeded clarify-skip) as well as point 3, because T74/T75's auto-resume path ('skips clarification per K8 pt4') depends on point 4 remaining in force. T72's four required points cover point 3 but do not pin that point 4 is untouched; add a one-line 'K8 points 1,2,4,5 remain in force; only point 3's handoff-direction asymmetry is refined' so the executor does not over-read the supersession.","T78 (verify) inherits the T74 gap: its grep set checks the caps are GONE ('4-iteration|8 rounds|safety ceiling') but has NO positive check that a concrete cross-chain ill-loop/termination criterion was ADDED. Add an acceptance clause to T78 that asserts plan/advance.md contains enumerated auto-investigate stop predicates (not merely the absence of a numeric cap), so removing the cap without adding a real stop cannot pass verification."]

(1 HIGHEST-RISK) T74 pt4 now enumerates concrete cross-chain termination predicates (a-f): once-per-defect-per-round; no-relaunch-without-new-confirmed-evidence; stop+report once a confirmed root cause seeded/extended its goal; park on non-converging open->investigated->replanned->open cycle; park after two consecutive no-adjudicable-evidence rounds; per-pass budget governed by (a)-(e). It explicitly states the generic single-worktree signals do NOT satisfy this. Acceptance (d) restates them as required. Resolved. (2) T74 pt3 specifies the awaiting-answers + defects-filed interaction: filed defects are orthogonal and still auto-investigated even when the goal is parked in `clarifying`, but planning does NOT auto-resume on a clarifying-parked goal. Resolved. (3) T73 + T74 pt2 make the LEDGER QUERY (open defects newly linked goals:<G>, no terminal status) the authoritative worklist; prose-summary parsing demoted to advisory; T73 acceptance forbids mandating any summary parse. Resolved. (4) T72 now requires the explicit 'K8 points 1,2,4,5 remain in force; only point 3 handoff-direction refined' line and pins that pt4 (defect-seeded clarify-skip) must stay because T74/T75 auto-resume depends on it; pt3's prohibition on investigate running the plan loop inline still stands. Resolved. (5) T78 pt4 adds a POSITIVE stop-predicate presence grep ('caps removed cannot pass without convergence guaranteed'); conjoined with pt3 (caps GONE) it catches the exact targeted regression of caps-removed-but-stop-condition-missing. Resolved.","CONVERGENCE PROOF (crux confirmed): within a plan:advance pass the worklist is the finite set of open defects at auto-investigate-phase entry; predicate (a) processes each at most once; new defects are only filed by the in-round planner<->reviewer loop which completes before the auto-investigate phase runs; predicate (c) halts relaunch once a defect seeds/extends a goal (planning then resumes on that goal, itself bounded by planner<->reviewer convergence); predicates (b)/(d)/(e) force a park-to-user on no-new-evidence / non-convergence / two-consecutive-no-evidence. Each predicate is a ledger-state comparison, so the stop is operationally checkable. The cap-free loop terminates.","BY-POINTER CHECK (T75/T77 do not silently reintroduce summary-parsing or drop a stop condition): T75 binds plan/start.md + follow-up.md to 'mirror plan/advance.md new phase (T-A3)' by pointer to the WHOLE T74 auto-investigate phase (which carries both the ledger-query worklist and the stop predicates) and its acceptance requires running /investigate:advance inline by pointer to that phase, not by re-deriving a worklist from a summary -- so the ledger-query authority and the stop predicates are inherited, not duplicated or weakened. T77 is wording-only, explicitly defers mechanics to T74/T75/T76, correctly keeps investigate->plan handback as file-and-defer (K8 pt3 stands) and keeps implement:* file-and-defer (Q43 names only plan:* as triggers). NON-BLOCKING NOTE for the executor (does not flip the verdict): T75 pt1 phrase 'if the plan-advance subagent flagged filed defects' should be read as the ledger-query existence check (no-op when none filed), NOT a parse of an advisory summary flag -- the binding acceptance and the by-pointer reference to T74's ledger-query phase govern; keep the trigger ledger-query-authoritative when implementing T75 to avoid re-importing the brittle summary contract R31#3 removed. Plan is fine-grained, correctly sequenced (T72 root; T73/T74 depend on it; T75/T77 depend on T74; T78 depends on all M17 tasks; M16 T69/T70->T71 independent), testable (each carries a grep/fetch/`bun run check` acceptance), grounded, and complete against the goal description.
