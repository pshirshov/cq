/**
 * D61 regression reproduction (H41 root cause) — lost update across two
 * independent git-object stores over ONE repo + orphan ref.
 *
 * Scenario: two separately-registered `cq mcp` processes back the SAME repo on
 * the SAME orphan ref (`cq-ledger`). Each holds its OWN GitObjectLedgerBackend
 * instance with NO onMutation wired between them — so there is NO
 * cross-invalidation (the D-COHERENCE channel that LOCK-D01 relies on is
 * absent), exactly the production condition that triggered D61.
 *
 * The interleave is driven as SEQUENTIAL awaited calls. The bug is NOT a lock
 * race: the shared real-fs advisory lockfile under `docs/.locks` already
 * serialises the two writers. The defect is the POST-LOCK STALE CACHE — under
 * git-object the write path never reloads the in-memory ledger from the
 * orphan-ref tip after taking the cross-process write lock. So:
 *   - storeB's in-memory `ledgers` map (built at init() from the ref tip it saw)
 *     never observes storeA's later commits;
 *   - createMilestone allocates M<n> from storeB's STALE in-memory counter
 *     (reusing an id storeA already allocated);
 *   - writeLedgerFile serializes storeB's WHOLE stale in-memory ledger, and
 *     GitPersistence.advance replaces milestones.md with that stale blob;
 *   - the lock serialised the writers so the CAS expectedOld matches the tip and
 *     updateRef fast-forwards with no StaleRefError → storeB silently clobbers
 *     storeA's milestone and reuses its id.
 *
 * The three assertions below FAIL TODAY (D61 reproduces): the lost write drops
 * one of storeA's titles AND duplicates an M<n> id. To keep `bun run check`
 * GREEN while committing the reproduction, the body runs under bun's
 * `test.failing` — a failing body is reported as an EXPECTED failure (suite
 * green, exit 0); if the body ever unexpectedly PASSES (i.e. the fix lands) the
 * suite turns RED, prompting T425 to flip this to a regular `test`.
 *
 * Touches NO production code — reproduction only.
