- summary: "REVISE (G38 round 1; full panel opus[claude]+codex+grok+minimax[pi], 4/4 usable, all revise → reconciled revise). Plan is fine-grained/acyclic/grounded/complete, but the agentsCatalogue.gen.ts regen for the advance.md edits is mis-sequenced (LOAD-BEARING, opus-verified against gen-agents-catalogue.ts L106/L142), the standalone test tasks are vague/duplicative, and several groundings/acceptances need correction. 0 new_questions, 0 out-of-scope defects."
- new_questions: []
- criticism: ["[opus] LOAD-BEARING: T308's parenthetical ('gen-agents covers agents/, not commands/ — no regen needed for a command file') is FALSE — VERIFIED against gen-agents-catalogue.ts: ROLES (L106) catalogues commands/cq/implement/advance.md (id 'implement/advance') and buildRole (L142) captures its full body as promptTemplate. Adding the markers to advance.md's BODY therefore DOES change agentsCatalogue.gen.ts and requires `bun run gen-agents`. Correct the justification.","[opus] Mis-sequencing + scope gap: T310 was the only task running gen-agents but had no dependsOn on T308/T309 and scoped the regen only around implement-worker.md; the advance.md body edits would silently desync agentsCatalogue.gen.ts, uncaught by T311/T321 which grep only the .md sources. FIX: make the gen-agents regen its OWN task depending on T308+T309+T310, and add a committed assertion that the regenerated gen.ts 'implement/advance' promptTemplate contains both advance.md markers.","[codex][grok] T309's dependsOn T308 has no logical prerequisite — the §1 sweep and §7.3 teardown edit disjoint sections of advance.md. Reconcile: re-justify the edge explicitly as SAME-FILE serialization (avoid a concurrent-worktree merge conflict on advance.md).","[codex][grok] T310 read as unjustified scope vs Q167 + used inconsistent 'post-merge teardown' vs the locked 'after the per-task done write' terminology. Resolve against the [opus] finding (regen IS required): keep worker.md alignment as item-1a prompt scope, align terminology, move the regen to its own sequenced task.","[codex][grok] Standalone test tasks T314/T317/T320 are vague 'consolidated/dedupe' meta-tasks while the impl acceptances already enumerate the same tests — and a separate test task is incoherent for this flow (each impl worktree must pass `bun run check` WITH its own tests). FIX: fold the test cells into the owning impl tasks and DROP T314/T317/T320.","[codex] D44 severity 'minor' vs Q172 'low/medium' — align it (defect already filed; no separate filing task needed).","[codex] T318/T319 'shared helper' for raw Home/End ESC sequences is unscoped — name the module/function (a module-level helper in ledger-tui/src/app.tsx, reused by both focus branches).","[grok] T312 mandates a new FsLedgerStoreOpts flag not implied by Q168/Q169; the only test-affordance needed is honoring XDG_CACHE_HOME. Drop/soften the flag.","[grok] T308 acceptance hinges on the literal 'Claude: auto' — VERIFIED present (implement/advance.md L310-311), so grounded; keep but phrase robustly.","[opus][codex][minimax] T313 adding `restore` CONTRADICTS the main.ts header (L23-24: lifecycle ops live in the `cq` CLI; 'this server only serves the tool surface') — VERIFIED main.ts only parses --cwd/--http. T313 must ALSO update that header comment.","[grok][minimax] T317's '(dedupe with T315)' mislabels its sibling (should be T316) — mooted by dropping T317.","[minimax] T310's acceptance mixes byte-faithful + contains-marker invariants — split (handled by moving the regen to its own task with split acceptance)."]

Addressing them anyway for precision; convergent.

T311/T322 acceptance use the shorthand 'advance.md'/'implement-worker.md' — make them name the full path + catalogue key so there is no ambiguity about which artifact each marker/promptTemplate assertion targets.","[codex] T322 omits the invocation cwd for `bun run gen-agents`: the 1a edits live under nix/pkg/cq-assets/ but the gen-agents script is a package script of the cq-ledgers workspace — state explicitly that it runs from nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/ (per CLAUDE.md the bun commands run from there), to avoid an exec error.","[codex] T312's cacheMirrorDir formula writes a bare 'basename'/'sha256(absRoot)' — qualify it: path.basename(absRoot) and crypto.createHash('sha256').update(absRoot).digest('hex').slice(0,12), and have the acceptance pin the FULL computed dir name (basename + '-' + 12hex), not only the suffix regex."]

The prompt catalog/spike share no technical coupling with cq-init/flows/ideas. Either drop the cross-workstream edges or record them as ADVISORY ordering (not blocking prerequisites) so an unrelated milestone stall doesn't block M139.","[opus][grok] T334 misdiagnoses the edge-label defect: every ROLE_FLOWS edge ALREADY carries a non-empty label and DiagramSvg/diagramLayout already render per-edge labels by index, so T334's data-only acceptance ('no empty label' + 'parallel labels distinct') PASSES against current code WITHOUT fixing the user-visible symptom ('arrows with no labels' = a RENDERING fault on parallel/feedback edges). T334 must reproduce the rendering defect (a layout/render test asserting each parallel edge's label actually places + displays distinctly in the Flows-tab SVG) and scope the fix to the layout/render path, not just label-text authoring.","[codex][grok] T334's 'planDoc' artifact is undefined (no such file/constant/draft exists). Name a CONCRETE reviewable deliverable for the proposed edge labels (e.g. a specific docs/drafts/<ts>-flows-edge-labels.md note, or ROLE_FLOWS source comments, or a test fixture) instead of a nonexistent 'planDoc'.","[opus][codex][grok] M139/T336 may add Ajv (a validator not in the cq-ledgers workspace deps) but NO task carries the mandatory post-dependency step from CLAUDE.md: refresh the flake.nix FOD `outputHash` (52 A's → `nix build .#node-modules` → paste `got:` hash) after a `bun.lock` change — otherwise `nix build .#node-modules` breaks. Prefer a validator ALREADY in-workspace to avoid the dependency; if a new dep is unavoidable, add the FOD-refresh step to T336/T341 (or a dedicated task).","[codex][grok] T340/T342 acceptance is NON-OPERATIONAL ('rubric review confirms', 'asset-link check passes') and does not name the concrete implementation sites. Make acceptance observable (a grep/test/`bun run check` invariant) and identify the exact edit loci (cq-assets command markdown ONLY, vs any tokenization/arg-parsing/MCP-dispatch/ledgerRefs logic) for the I-id grammar + the shared consume-an-idea sub-procedure.","[codex][grok][minimax] T340's 'mixed free-text handling' is ungrounded vs Q188 (which gives a pure idea-id grammar, '/cq:plan I01 I02 I03'). Either DEFINE 'mixed' precisely (idea-ids interleaved with prose?) or DROP it and stick to Q188's grammar.","[grok][minimax] T338's 'fail-loud on symlink/dir even under --force' is UNREQUESTED scope deviating from Q184 ('--force to overwrite'). Revert T338 to Q184's literal behaviour (skip-with-message if cq.toml exists; --force overwrites) and drop the symlink/dir fail-loud (or demote it to a non-blocking safety note that does not contradict --force).","[opus][codex][grok] T336/T341/T345 conflate orchestrator-command roles (agentTierKey===null / not-model-configurable, never dispatched-with-validated-input by a parent) with dispatched-subagent roles. Distinguish them: only dispatched subagents get input/output JSON Schemas + validate-in/out wiring; T345's blanket 'every catalogued role reachable via fetch_prompt with validate-in/out' is over-broad for orchestrator commands.","[opus] T335 ships terminalStatuses:['planned','discarded'] while its OWN note leaves `planned` terminality unresolved. Decide it decisively (the consume-idea flow implies an idea moved to 'planned' stays planned → terminal) and align the transition map; do not ship a schema whose terminalStatuses is provisional/load-bearing-but-flagged.","[codex][minimax] T341's 'extend cq-assets Catalogue blocks OR sibling per-role schema files' leaves the schema STORAGE FORMAT undecided (forces an in-flight choice). Commit to ONE representation in the plan (per-role JSON Schema files, or schema fields embedded in the Catalogue blocks).","[grok] T333 mixes investigation + implementation without naming the EXACT derivation site for zero-outgoing-edge→terminal:true (inside DiagramSvg from its edges prop? a ROLE_FLOWS preprocessing step in roleActions.ts? the layout?) and any required RoleNode type/layout edits. Make it a crisp deliverable naming the concrete site.","[codex] T331 cites 'basis cq.toml.example' but no task creates/commits cq.toml.example. Clarify that cq.toml.example is an EXISTING read-basis already in the repo (not new work) — or, if it does not exist, add the step; do not leave the reference dangling."]

Pin this explicitly in T378/T379.","[codex+grok+minimax] T377 must REUSE the prefixedToolNames/prefixToolName helper from T373 (Q208: 'derive prefixed names ONCE + reuse') rather than an independent ad-hoc whole-word replace driven separately from LEDGER_TOOL_NAMES — the whole-word approach is brittle and risks drift; derive from the single source.","[codex+minimax] T374 should carry the SAME 'verify every other call site inherits the default \\'\\' param' clause that T375 has, for consistency — so any other createLedgerMcpTools consumer is confirmed unbroken.","[codex+grok, minor] T380's dependsOn T379 (CLI flag) is likely unnecessary: the two-prefixed-servers collision test exercises createLedgerMcpServer PROGRAMMATICALLY, not the --tool-prefix CLI; drop the T379 edge (keep T378) to avoid over-sequencing."]

All 6 R450 criticisms verified resolved: T378.dependsOn=[T377,T375]; T379 threads the full main()→serveHttp→attachMcpHttp chain with an end-to-end HTTP prefixedToolNames assertion; optional default-'' param pinned (Q209); T377 reuses the prefixedToolNames helper; T374 verify-call-sites clause; T380.dependsOn dropped T379. Plan fine-grained, correctly sequenced (no cycles/forward deps), testable, grounded, complete vs Q211 1-5."
