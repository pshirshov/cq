- summary: "DRAINED. This /cq:advance run folded in the user's answers (Q117-Q124) and drove three goals + one defect from intake to landed code. INVESTIGATE: completed D34's file-and-defer (seeded defect-seeded goal G27 from the confirmed H26 root cause; the prior /cq:investigate run had marked D34 root-caused but omitted the seed). PLAN: advanced G27 (defect-seeded), G25 (retire 5 legacy skills), G26 (session-log markdown popup) to `planned` via the planner<->reviewer loop (G25 took one revise round, R248->R249; G26/G27 one round each). IMPLEMENT: built and merged all 14 tasks T207-T220 across work milestones M83 (G27/D34 fix: progressTotal denominator), M84 (G25: archived 5 skills to docs/legacy-skills/, de-registered via readDir, repointed refs, nix build green), M85 (G26: modal overlay CSS + LogModal->Markdown + read_log 4MiB cap + tests). All per-task reviews go-ahead. D34 RESOLVED (T207-T209). Archived M79 (D34 investigate), M83, M84, M85. Final predicate gate: P-investigate=FALSE (no non-terminal defects), P-plan=FALSE (no clarifying/planning goal), P-implement=FALSE (no non-terminal tasks), open-question gate clear. Nothing actionable remains. OPERATIONAL NOTE: a background process kept committing divergent 'pi ollama'/'pi config' commits and the Agent worktrees repeatedly branched from a stale commit (4891fa0); merge-back was reconciled via cherry-pick onto main each time and the integrated tree verified green (bun run check 1019/0; nix build .#llm-skills green). NEXT (user action, optional): goals G25, G26, G27 are `planned` with all work milestones archived and all tasks done/merged — ready for you to CLOSE in the TUI/web (set to done); G23 + G24 from prior runs are also building/ready to close. Goals never auto-close. Once closed, the next /cq:advance sweep archives their coordination milestones (M80/M81/M82 etc.). Also still open from before: M11 carries a dangling non-terminal hypothesis H3 (D34-unrelated; investigate-flow's to adjudicate)."

- summary: "BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS. /cq:advance ran one cycle on the only actionable item, goal G28 (\"Enable subagent support in the pi agent harness for the cq flow\"). PLAN stage: the user had answered the first batch Q125-Q129, but Q125 (the load-bearing mechanism choice) was a COUNTER-QUESTION (\"give me pros/cons + how hard is a custom extension + downsides\"), so the goal stayed in its clarification sub-state and no plan could be emitted (configured multi-planner panel not run — clarification, not plan-emission, was the state). A single-planner pass grounded read-only in the real Pi extension surface (dev-llm.nix programs.pi wiring, the two extant nix/pkg/pi-extensions/*.ts, pi-context.md, mergedAgents frontmatter, the per-harness dispatch convention, and cq.toml) and filed Q130 answering the counter-question with a grounded 3-way comparison (nicobailon/pi-subagents npm vs badlogic example vs bespoke in-repo pi.registerTool extension) and a justified recommendation for the bespoke extension. Decisions captured from the answered batch: Q126 = shared cq prompts must stay UNCHANGED across harnesses (Pi mechanism interprets the existing named-agent+task dispatch convention); Q127 = orchestrator names which agent to run + fast/standard/frontier tier->provider mapping lives in cq.toml (needs a new [tiers] table); Q128 = acceptance is one explorer dispatch + one reviewer dispatch returning parseable results on THIS repo non-sandboxed first (sandbox+implement-worker is a follow-up); Q129 = no Nix-vendoring needed for a third-party ext, user biased to custom because a custom extension is also needed later for deterministic orchestration-session logic.

KEY FINDING: the user's premise that a colon separator collides with the harness split is FALSE — both parsers split on the FIRST colon only, so `pi:ollama-cloud:minimax-m3` already parses cleanly to {harness:pi, model:'ollama-cloud:minimax-m3'}. The real reconciliation is the IN-MODEL provider separator: the extension's tokenToChildModel extracts provider on `/` (T225-shipped, matching D36's suggestedFix), while @cq/config extracts NO provider at all and ReviewerToken has no provider field; the two layers are deliberate copies (extension can't import @cq/config, K46).
