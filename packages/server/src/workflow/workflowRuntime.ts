/**
 * workflowRuntime.ts — deterministic engine behind `/plan` (cycle 3: full loop).
 *
 * Phase 1 (`startPlan`) produces a goal(clarifying) + the mandatory spec
 * milestone + a first question batch. Cycle 3 drives the rest:
 *
 *   Phase 2 — clarify loop (human-gated by answers).
 *     When the last open question for the goal flips to answered, dispatch the
 *     clarify-reviewer. Not clear / new questions → HARNESS writes the new
 *     questions under the spec milestone, emit questions_ready, wait. Clear →
 *     phase 3.
 *   Phase 3 — planner.
 *     Dispatch the planner with the clarified scope + Q&A. HARNESS writes the
 *     planner milestones (after the spec milestone) + tasks grouped under them,
 *     all linked to the goal. Goal status → planning.
 *   Phase 4 — plan-review loop (adversarial; no hard cap, Q6).
 *     Dispatch the plan-reviewer. satisfied → goal status planned + a `done`
 *     lifecycle frame. not satisfied + newQuestions → write them, emit
 *     questions_ready, wait; on answer re-run the clarify gate then re-plan.
 *     not satisfied + no questions → re-dispatch the planner with the findings.
 *     A NO-PROGRESS liveness guard escalates (and STOPS) if a revise round
 *     produces NO LEDGER UPDATE — no net change to the goal's milestones/tasks
 *     AND no new questions — so a reviewer↔planner runaway cannot spin without
 *     human input. The trigger is derived from DURABLE ledger state (the goal's
 *     plan structure before vs after the round's write), not an in-memory hash,
 *     so it survives a server restart mid-loop.
 *
 * Durable state = the LEDGERS (closes WF-D02). The workflow's position is a
 * pure function of goal.status + whether the goal's questions are all answered;
 * `reconcile()` resumes the right phase on startup. The only in-memory state is
 * the global busy slot (pool=1 for the workflow lane), the per-goal in-flight
 * latch (prevents double-dispatch / double-auto-advance), and the per-goal
 * platform (Claude-only this cycle; defaults to claude on resume). The
 * no-progress guard holds NO in-memory state — it compares ledger snapshots.
 *
 * The HARNESS owns all ledger writes; producer and phase subagents only return
 * validated structured data via their harness-owned submit tools.
