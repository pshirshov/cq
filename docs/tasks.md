    Edit DEFECTS_SCHEMA in packages/ledger/src/constants.ts.

Replace with the LOCKED target (Q66/Q67):
    
    statusValues = [open, wip, root-caused, inconclusive, resolved, wontfix]
    terminalStatuses = [resolved, wontfix]
    transitions = {
      open:        [wip, resolved, wontfix],        // Q67 VERBATIM: open->{wip, resolved, wontfix}. NO open->root-caused and NO open->inconclusive edge — root-caused/inconclusive are reachable ONLY from wip.

    NET DELTA vs the live schema: ADD root-caused + inconclusive; DROP blocked entirely; RENAME the terminal abandoned->wontfix (abandoned is removed everywhere). Keep the rootCause field (free-text narrative, Q68; markers removed) and severity (required).
    
    Update the doc-comment to describe the lifecycle (open->wip->{root-caused|inconclusive}->resolved|wontfix; root-caused is the queryable file-and-defer gate; inconclusive re-openable to wip). No baboon/model-version step (Q69 — direct edit). FsLedgerStore.init() guards on-disk schema divergence (backup-reinit default); the live-data migration of any defect on a removed status (blocked/abandoned) is handled by T122 — this task is the in-code constant + its unit tests.

Add/extend a unit test in packages/ledger asserting the new statusValues/terminalStatuses and that a wip->root-caused->resolved path and a wip->inconclusive->wip path are ACCEPTED while a removed edge (open->blocked) and an illegal direct open->root-caused are REJECTED. `bun run check` green."

- description: |
    Rewrite the investigate-flow adjudication + file-and-defer sections of llm/commands/investigate/advance.md (and llm/commands/investigate/start.md if it restates the marker convention) so defect STATUS — not a rootCause prose marker — carries the lifecycle.
    
    TRANSITION-LEGALITY (BLOCKING, per R111): Q67's locked transition map has NO open->root-caused edge — root-caused is reachable ONLY from wip. Today the investigate flow (step 5a) NEVER sets the defect's STATUS; the lifecycle lives entirely on the HYPOTHESIS tree (open|uncertain|confirmed|wrong) and rootCause is written as narrative + citations. So the flow MUST move the defect open->wip when it BEGINS investigating (the adjudication step / step where an explorer starts work), making the path open->wip->root-caused — both edges legal per Q67. A direct open->root-caused write WOULD throw InvalidTransitionError against the server's strict transition guard. Make the wip transition EXPLICIT in the adjudication task.
    
    Thus, edit the prompt to instruct: (1) when investigation STARTS on an `open` defect, update_item status=wip (explicit); (2) on a CONFIRMED root cause, update_item status=root-caused (legal from wip); (3) on an investigated-but-unpinned cause, update_item status=inconclusive (legal from wip; re-openable to wip). The rootCause FIELD stays as the free-text cause NARRATIVE (Q68) WITHOUT lifecycle tokens. The file-and-defer seeding gate becomes 'status == root-caused' (Q68). Update any prose that says 'confirmed root cause'/'mark rootCause CONFIRMED' to the status-based phrasing. Keep the explorer-dispatch + citation-validation behaviour unchanged.
- acceptance: "grep of llm/commands/investigate/*.md shows NO remaining instruction to stuff UNKNOWN/CONFIRMED/GROUNDED into rootCause; the prompt EXPLICITLY instructs update_item status=wip when investigation begins on an open defect (so no direct open->root-caused write occurs), then status=root-caused (confirmed) / status=inconclusive (unpinned) at adjudication; the file-and-defer precondition is stated as status==root-caused; the documented path is open->wip->{root-caused|inconclusive} (Q67-legal). `bun run check` green (markdown-only; no-op gate)."

- description: |
    Update llm/commands/plan/advance.md AND llm/agents/plan-advance.md so the DEFECT-STATUS worklist + file-and-defer SEED GATE key off the queryable defect STATUS — NOT a prose marker.
    
    SCOPE (BLOCKING DISTINCTION, per R111 — be SURGICAL about which 'confirmed' is which):
    - CHANGE (defect lifecycle): the auto-investigate WORKLIST (plan/advance.md:92-98 + plan-advance.md:248-249, currently keyed on status:open) and the file-and-defer SEED GATE. New semantics: the worklist treats `open`/`wip`/`inconclusive` defects as still-ACTIONABLE, `root-caused` as READY-TO-SEED (the seed gate becomes status==root-caused, replacing any 'confirmed root cause' prose check), and `resolved`/`wontfix` as terminal/EXCLUDED. Replace any prose marker checks (rootCause CONFIRMED/UNKNOWN) here with status queries.
    - PRESERVE (hypothesis tree — DO NOT TOUCH): the K12 stop-predicates (b)/(c)/(d) at plan/advance.md:150-164 reason over the HYPOTHESIS TREE (hypothesis status `confirmed` + `[correct]` evidence — the investigate adjudication + ill-loop/convergence detector), which is a SEPARATE concept from the defect lifecycle. A blanket 're-key every confirmed node/confirmed root cause to status==root-caused' would CORRUPT these. Leave the hypothesis-tree `confirmed`-node vocabulary and the stop predicates' hypothesis reasoning INTACT. Only the defect-STATUS seed gate / worklist references change.
    
    Keep the auto-investigate ledger-query mechanism (re-derive worklist from the ledger) intact; only the defect-status predicate vocabulary changes.

- description: |
    Two SURGICAL edits to llm/commands/implement/advance.md, both grounded against the live file (R111 corrected the original premise):
    
    (a) MILESTONE-COMPLETION terminal vocabulary (the MISSED touch-point, BLOCKING-adjacent): line 198 states the defect terminal set as `resolved`/`abandoned`. The locked schema (T116) RENAMES abandoned->wontfix and DROPS blocked, so this line references a REMOVED status. Edit :198 (and grep the whole file for any OTHER `abandoned` defect-terminal reference) to read `resolved`/`wontfix`. This is the primary content of this task.
    
    (b) REVIEWER-FILED defects section (lines 96-117): the original T121 premise was WRONG — this section ALREADY files reviewer defects with status:open and fields {headline, description, severity, suggestedFix?}; it writes NO rootCause marker and NO CONFIRMED/UNKNOWN token. So there is NOTHING to remove here. The ONLY action for this section is to CONFIRM it stays status=open (untriaged; a defect reaches root-caused only via an investigate pass, never directly from the implement reviewer) and that it sets NO removed status (blocked/abandoned). Do NOT instruct the implementer to hunt for a nonexistent rootCause marker.
    
    NOTE: implement/advance.md is ALSO edited by the M31 N=4->8 bump (T127) and the milestone-sweep predicate task (T128) — this task lands first (M33 precedes M31); those M31 tasks declare dependsOn this task to serialize the shared file.
- acceptance: "grep of llm/commands/implement/advance.md shows (a) the milestone-completion defect-terminal reference at ~:198 reads `resolved`/`wontfix` with NO remaining `abandoned` (nor `blocked`) defect-status reference anywhere in the file; (b) the reviewer-filed-defects section still creates defects with status=open and {headline,description,severity,suggestedFix?} (unchanged), with rootCause used as narrative only and no removed status written. `bun run check` green (markdown-only)."

- description: "After the schema lands (T116), perform a one-shot update_item migration of every live NON-terminal defect to the new vocabulary (Q69): for each, read its current status + rootCause marker and set the new status — a defect whose rootCause carried CONFIRMED/GROUNDED → root-caused; UNKNOWN-still-investigating → stays open (or wip if under active investigation); strip the marker token from rootCause leaving only the narrative. Also migrate any defect currently in a REMOVED status: status 'blocked' → open or wip (per its situation); status 'abandoned' (now removed; the terminal rename is abandoned→wontfix) → wontfix. The known live open defects are D13 (TUI nav latency, rootCause 'UNKNOWN' → stays open, marker stripped) and D20 (inspect its current marker). D13/D20 are MIGRATED ONLY, not fixed (explicitly out of scope). Re-query the defects ledger at execution time for the authoritative live set — do not trust this list. Use update_item via the ledger MCP (author/session set); do NOT hand-edit docs/defects.md. No permanent on-load coercion in the store (Q69)."
- acceptance: "Every live non-terminal defect carries a status from the new set [open, wip, root-caused, inconclusive] (or terminal resolved/wontfix); no live defect remains in a removed status (blocked/abandoned); no rootCause field contains a UNKNOWN/CONFIRMED/GROUNDED lifecycle token (narrative text only). Confirm via fts_search/fetch over the defects ledger. D13/D20 unchanged except status/rootCause-marker migration. `bun run check` green."

- description: "backupAndReinit is currently a PRIVATE method (packages/ledger/src/store/FsLedgerStore.ts:694) invoked only from init()'s schema-divergence branch. Add a public async reset() method (or make backupAndReinit public) that the --reset CLI wrapper can call on a freshly-constructed (NOT-yet-serving) store: it must perform the same timestamped docs/.backup/<ts>/ snapshot + fresh canonical reinit, and RETURN a small summary the CLI can print (Q64) — e.g. { backupDir: absolute path, ledgers: Array<{ name, itemCount }> } counting items in each active ledger BEFORE the wipe. Reuse backupAndReinit verbatim for the snapshot/reinit (Q65); the reset() wrapper adds only the pre-count + the returned summary. FS-only (InMemory store needs no parallel — Q65). Keep init()'s existing private call-site working (if backupAndReinit stays private, reset() pre-counts then calls it; if made public, init still calls it). Export any new public type from @cq/ledger index.ts as needed."

(2) main() short-circuits when reset is set: construct the FsLedgerStore for the resolved cwd, print a per-ledger summary of what will be backed up (counts — obtain by init()+count or via the reset() summary), then CONFIRM per Q64 — if process.stdin.isTTY and NOT --yes, prompt 'Reset ledgers at <cwd>? Backup will be written to docs/.backup/. [y/N] ' and proceed only on y/Y; if --yes, skip the prompt (unattended); if NOT a TTY and NOT --yes, REFUSE with a non-zero exit + a message instructing --yes (a non-interactive run must not wipe silently). On confirm, call store.reset() (T123), print the returned backupDir + summary, and return (NO server started; process exits 0). Do NOT start the watcher/HTTP/stdio server on the reset path. Keep the existing serve paths unchanged when --reset is absent."
- acceptance: parseArgs recognises --reset/--yes (unit test). `ledger-mcp --cwd <tmp> --reset --yes` backs up + reinits the tmp ledger tree and exits 0 without serving (integration-style test invoking main() with --yes on a seeded tmp dir asserts docs/.backup/<ts>/ created, live tree reset, no server bound). A non-TTY invocation WITHOUT --yes exits non-zero and does NOT modify the tree. `bun run check` green.
