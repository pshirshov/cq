/**
 * LedgerStore — abstract interface implemented by the production
 * FsLedgerStore and the test-only InMemoryLedgerStore.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *  1. Construct.
 *  2. `init()` — load all known ledgers (from ./docs/ledgers.yaml + their .md
 *     files) into memory. After init the store serves reads from memory. The
 *     bootstrapped `milestones` ledger is created on first init if absent.
 *  3. Read methods are synchronous (in-memory) unless they touch disk
 *     (`fetchArchive`).
 *  4. Mutating methods are async (acquire mutex(es) + lockfile(s) + persist).
 *  5. `dispose()` — release any in-process resources.
 *
 * Locking discipline (msunify cycle):
 *  - Per-ledger mutex + lockfile for purely within-ledger ops.
 *  - Global `__milestones__` mutex + lockfile for any operation that
 *    mutates the milestones ledger OR creates/archives an item that
 *    references the milestones ledger.
 *  - Multi-lock acquisition order: `__milestones__` first; then per-ledger
 *    locks in alphabetical order. Documented in FsLedgerStore.
