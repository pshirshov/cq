- criticism: ["T27 mis-grounds summarize() as a shared util: it is duplicated VERBATIM in packages/ledger-tui/src/app.tsx:63 and packages/ledger-web/src/App.tsx:110 (both bodies: f[\"headline\"] ?? f[\"title\"] ?? f[\"question\"] ?? f[\"summary\"] ?? Object.values(f)[0]). T27's description assumes one shared location and its acceptance only names happy-dom WEB tests. The TUI copy ALSO falls through to the long criticism string[] for legacy reviews and needs the same truncate-first-criticism fallback. Fix: scope BOTH summarize() copies in T27 (or split a TUI-summarize subtask), and add an ink-testing-library assertion that a legacy review with no summary renders a truncated single line in the TUI, not the full joined criticism. As written, Req5 is only half-delivered for the TUI.","T34 bundles an objective automated gate (bun run check) with five manual observed-vs-expected smoke checks into one mega-task; the manual halves are not independently verifiable. Where feasible, fold each request's verification into the per-task acceptance tests it already owns (T30/T31/T32/T33/T27 each name happy-dom or ink tests) and reduce T34 to the green-check gate plus any cross-cutting regression assertion, rather than a manual five-point sweep.","T26 acceptance overstates the canonical-ledgers test: that test (packages/ledger/test/canonical-ledgers.test.ts) does NOT assert an exact reviews field-SET — it exercises specific fields plus a schema-divergence guard across docs/ledgers.yaml + examples/sample-ledger + the lib constant. Adding optional summary keeps it green but is not 'verified' by it. Either add an explicit assertion that REVIEWS_SCHEMA.fields.summary exists (type string, required:false) and that all three registry copies declare it, or reword T26's acceptance to claim only divergence-guard parity, not field-set assertion."]

- new_questions: []
- criticism: ["T37 (and the T35 decision lock) under-specify the investigation->planning handoff and conflate two incompatible mechanisms. T37 acceptance says on a confirmed root cause /investigate:advance should 'HAND OFF to plan-flow ... then the standard plan-advance<->plan-reviewer cycle produces reviewed fix tasks'. But /plan:advance (llm/commands/plan/advance.md) IS itself a command whose body runs the planner<->reviewer loop by spawning plan-advance/plan-reviewer subagents; a command cannot invoke another command's loop. So 'run the cycle' resolves to EITHER (a) /investigate:advance re-implements the plan loop inline (duplicates the loop that already lives in /plan:advance, and contradicts the Q26 file-and-defer integration principle the rest of the plan adopts), OR (b) it writes rootCause/suggestedFix, creates/extends the goal, and DEFERS to the user to run /plan:advance. The plan must pick (b) explicitly (consistent with Q26 file-and-defer + resumability) and state it in both T35's locked decision and T37's acceptance; as written the executor could build either.","T37/T35 do not specify the clarify-skip for the seeded goal. Q25 hands a defect with an ALREADY-confirmed root cause to plan-flow, but /plan:start and /plan:follow-up both re-open the goal to `clarifying` and spawn plan-advance for a FRESH clarifying round (llm/commands/plan/{start,follow-up}.md). Re-clarifying a defect whose root cause is confirmed is redundant. The handoff task must state how the seeded goal enters planning without a wasted clarifying round (e.g. seed the goal description with the confirmed root cause + suggestedFix so plan-advance has nothing left to clarify, or document that the planner may skip clarification when the goal is defect-seeded). Currently neither T35 nor T37 addresses this, leaving the executor to guess.","Cross-milestone dependency on the #1 follow-up (M6) is unstated and risks a same-file conflict. T42 edits implement-reviewer.md's returned-JSON contract to add `defects[]`, and its description asserts the contract 'currently' carries 'taskId/verdict/criticism/questions/rationale, plus the `summary` from the #1 follow-up'. But M6/T28 (the task that adds `summary` to that exact JSON contract) is still `planned`, and M8 dependsOn M7 ONLY (not M6). If M8 runs before M6/T28, T42's stated premise is false and two tasks edit the same JSON block in implement-reviewer.md independently. Either add M6 (or T28) to T42/M8's dependsOn, or reword T42 so its acceptance does not presuppose the `summary` field already exists (state the defects[] addition is independent of the summary work). Same applies to T40/T28 both editing plan-reviewer.md.","T44 acceptance is not operationally verifiable, repeating the defect R3 already flagged on the old T34. Its acceptance is 'A short written audit (in the task completion / PR description) confirming the closed loop ... with any drift corrected' plus 'no contradictory routing language remains' - a subjective prose deliverable, not a checkable command/invariant. The only mechanical clause is `bun run check` green (which a markdown-only consistency task cannot actually exercise for routing correctness). Tighten the acceptance to a verifiable form: e.g. a grep-able invariant (every fix task references `defects:` in ledgerRefs; no prompt instructs implement to execute a defect directly; the `[correct]`/`[incorrect]` evidence convention string appears identically in investigate-explorer + investigate/advance), so the audit's conclusion rests on enumerable checks rather than a narrative."]

Three under-specified acceptances need tightening before build (below).","T65/T66 (#7 title seam) is under-specified about HOW the displayName reaches the client. Verified: buildServer(store) constructs `new McpServer(SERVER_INFO,{instructions})` where SERVER_INFO is a module constant {name,version} and buildServer receives only `store`, NOT cwd (packages/ledger-mcp/src/main.ts L49,L183-190); the server.ts the planner could not find does not exist (main.ts is the wiring). To surface basename(--cwd), T65 must thread `cwd` into buildServer/attachMcpHttp AND into the embedded TUI (in-memory transport) and embedded web (co-hosted /mcp) hosts that call them. The MCP Implementation/serverInfo type carries only name/version/title, so the displayName must ride in name/title or in `instructions`; T66's McpLedgerClient must read it via the SDK (client.getServerVersion()/getInstructions()). Add to T65 acceptance: cwd is threaded into buildServer and the basename rides a NAMED carrier (serverInfo.title or instructions). Add to T66: the real client reads that exact carrier (not just the fake).","T54 (#4 array-editor delimiter) defers the id[] delimiter decision to the implementer ('id[] only if it does not regress ... choose one rule and apply identically'). dependsOn/blockedBy are id[] (COMMON_REF_FIELDS) and existing multi-id entry/tests may rely on comma-splitting. The plan must DECIDE the id[] rule (lowest-risk: keep comma for id[], switch only string[] to semicolon/newline) rather than leaving 'choose one rule' inside the task - that is an unscoped decision embedded in a task.","T55 (#4 one-shot normalize) declares dependsOn:T54 but the normalize must split existing array ELEMENTS directly (each element on semicolons/newlines) to stay idempotent and independent of T54's editor-parser change; re-running update_item through a parseFieldValue that now also splits could double-process or behave inconsistently. Make T55's description explicit that it operates on stored array elements, not by re-invoking the editor parse path, so its asserted idempotence holds."]

No new defects, no out-of-scope faults. Verification detail follows.","R29 #1 RESOLVED (T65/T66, #7 title seam). Confirmed against packages/ledger-mcp/src/main.ts: buildServer(store) at L183 takes ONLY store (no cwd); SERVER_INFO={name,version} module const at L49; the referenced server.ts does not exist (main.ts is the wiring). T65 now threads cwd/displayName into buildServer and ALL four real call sites: stdio (L366), attachMcpHttp's inner buildServer (L258), embedded TUI in-memory host (packages/ledger-tui/src/mcpClient.ts L81, where embedded(cwd) already has cwd in scope), and embedded web co-hosted /mcp (packages/ledger-web/src/serve.ts via attachMcpHttp). NAMED carrier decided (serverInfo.title primary, instructions fallback) rather than left open. T66's read path is real: both McpLedgerClient classes wrap a private SDK Client, so getServerVersion() (Implementation.title) / getInstructions() are reachable, and T66 requires the client read the SAME carrier T65 wrote (not just the fake). The instructions fallback correctly hedges an SDK build that omits Implementation.title.","R29 #2 RESOLVED (T54, #4 delimiter). The id[] decision is now DECIDED in the task, not deferred: string[] splits on semicolon/newline, id[] KEEPS comma. Grounded against the identical parseFieldValue in both UIs (web App.tsx L144-149, TUI app.tsx L90-95) which today comma-split both string[] and id[]; suggestions is string[] (constants.ts L193) and dependsOn/blockedBy are id[] (COMMON_REF_FIELDS), so the split-by-type rule lands on the right fields. Lowest-risk, no id[] regression surface.","R29 #3 RESOLVED (T55, #4 normalize). dependsOn is now cleared to [] (stale [T54] removed, confirmed on the item). The task and acceptance now state normalization splits stored array ELEMENTS directly (not via parseFieldValue), making it idempotent by construction (already-split elements carry no semicolons/newlines; second run diffs to empty) and independent of T54's editor-parser change."]

Every task encodes the user's literal answer: T83/T84 (#12) implement the user's DEVIATION (Q48: 'flat list without subsections - as milestones list'), suppressing coordination subsections and rendering fields.milestones, NOT the planner's keep-grouping recommendation. T79 (#9, Q38) unifies archived groups into the collapsible-section renderer with an archived badge, default-collapsed + lazy-fetch on first expand (preserves the read-only/per-pointer fetch shipped in T32, drops the pointer-button path). T80/T81 (#10, Q40) correctly depend on the shared M12 palette (T80->T52 web BUCKET_HEX/CSS vars; T81->T51 TUI warning bucket) and reuse statusBucket+lw-status-<bucket> / statusColor with the milestones schema threaded in -- no new divergent color map. T82 (#11, Q41) is the standalone web-only colgroup CSS fix, independent of T60-T62. T85 (#13, Q49) acceptance is operationally verifiable -- instrument builder call counts and assert zero additional invocations on a pure cursor move, reproduction-first at N~500/1000 -- not 'make it faster'; its deps [T62,T81,T84] are justified, not over-coupled (all three mutate the TUI render path the useMemo keys must cover, so memoizing must land after them).

VERIFIED CORRECT: #16/T90 — ArchiveSubsections render site (App.tsx L1193) is gated only on showArchive+archivePointers, NOT on isMilestones (which IS in scope, L1232/L1246/L1258); adding `&& !isMilestones` is surgical and preserves the T79 unification for non-milestones (renderer at L1916-2019, tested app.test.tsx L688-722). #17/T91 — active head uses ms.title (L1847) vs archived head uses p.summary=description (L2000); fix is real. #18/T92 vs K13 — only implement/advance.md §3 (L103-108) actually contains a `/investigate:start <D>` routing-question step to DELETE; plan/advance.md (LEDGER-QUERY worklist L87-98, no routing-question) and plan-reviewer.md (defects[] report-only, L62-78) ALREADY conform, and T92's acceptance correctly treats those two as confirm/guard. One-time cleanup confirmed: Q52/Q53 withdrawn with full D3-D6 triage preserved on the defect records — no information loss, non-blocking file-and-defer retained. T92/T93 (prompts/CSS) are disjoint from T90→T91 (same App.tsx archive path) and parallel-safe; M21 dependsOn M19 is appropriate.","T93 (item 19) is mis-grounded: its description tells the implementer to 'tune the existing .lw-batch* rules' (width/max-width, height/max-height, font-size on `.lw-batch` / `.lw-batch-body`), but packages/ledger-web/src/styles.css (full 763-line file) contains NO `.lw-batch`, `.lw-batch-body`, or `.lw-batch-nav` rule at all. The batch modal (T63, done, commit e677b77) reused the HelpOverlay backdrop pattern; `.lw-batch` exists only as a MARKER class on the dialog element (app.test.tsx L1039 queries q('.lw-batch')) with no CSS rule backing it, and `.lw-batch-body`/`.lw-batch-nav` classes are unconfirmed anywhere (no test references them). Re-ground T93: state the work is to ADD/define `.lw-batch*` sizing rules (not 'tune' pre-existing ones), and confirm against the actual BatchAnswerModal markup which element(s) carry the box/body/nav classes the rules must target. The acceptance (assert width/height/font-size resolve to the new values via computed style or the literal CSS rule) is otherwise operational and survives the fix.","T91 (item 17) acceptance under-specifies the collapsed-head case and so does not truly leave the title-source mechanism free. Archived sections default COLLAPSED and lazy-fetch their group content (ArchiveSubsections App.tsx L1939-1981; app.test.tsx L724-754). The lazy-content option (deriving title from c.milestone.title) only populates AFTER first expand — so a COLLAPSED archived head built that way would show p.id or p.summary (description), NOT the title. The acceptance 'an archived section head displays the milestone title' is satisfiable on a collapsed head ONLY by the ArchivePointer-payload option (add `title` to the pointer; App.tsx L1932 + packages/ledger/src/types.ts ArchivePointer @ L155 + the server build). Pin the acceptance to assert the title shows on a COLLAPSED (un-expanded) archived head, which effectively forces the payload-extension path rather than leaving it 'implementer's choice'. NON-BLOCKING NOTE (not a new defect): open defect D5 already proposes adding the milestone STATUS to the same ArchivePointer/archive-group payload over MCP — coordinating T91's `title` extension with D5's `status` on the one ArchivePointer shape change would avoid two boundary edits; D5 stays deferred."]

Both R73 (revise) criticisms are genuinely resolved against source; the G2 follow-up #4 plan (M21: T90-T93, defects D7/D8) is fine-grained, correctly sequenced, testable, grounded, and complete for items 16/17/18/19. No new defects, no out-of-scope faults to file. Verification detail follows.","R73 #1 RESOLVED (T93 / item 19). Verified packages/ledger-web/src/styles.css (read L280-762, covering all overlay/dialog/modal/table regions) contains NO `.lw-batch`, `.lw-batch-body`, or `.lw-batch-nav` rule. The revised T93 description now states explicitly the work is to ADD/DEFINE new batch-modal sizing rules (not 'tune' pre-existing ones), specifies an explicit wider+taller box via vw/vh caps, a reduced font-size, and a body overflow-scroll rule for long questions, and instructs the implementer to FIRST confirm against the actual BatchAnswerModal JSX which element(s) carry the box/body/nav classes the rules must target (correct, since `.lw-batch` is a marker class with no backing rule). The acceptance (assert width/height/font-size resolve to the new values + body scroll, via computed style or the literal CSS rule under happy-dom) is operational and survives the re-grounding.","R73 #2 RESOLVED (T91 / item 17). Verified packages/ledger/src/types.ts ArchivePointer @ L155-162 is `{id, path, summary}` — no `title`, no `status`; and packages/ledger-web/src/App.tsx L2000 builds the archived head label from `p.summary` (= milestone description) for BOTH collapsed and expanded states, with group content (c) only lazy-fetched on expand. The revised T91 now states the title-source mechanism is NOT implementer's choice — it MUST extend the ArchivePointer payload (add `title` to types.ts + populate it in the server's archivePointer build, then use p.title) — and pins the acceptance to a COLLAPSED (un-expanded) archived head showing the milestone `title` (not description). This is satisfiable on a collapsed head ONLY via the payload extension (lazy c.milestone.title would not be populated pre-expand), so the acceptance genuinely forces the right path.","D5 COORDINATION COHERENT (T91). T91 now lands BOTH `title` (its own item 17 / D8 fix) and `status` (D5's prerequisite) in ONE ArchivePointer-payload + server-build edit; T91 ledgerRefs now include defects:D5. Verified D5 (open, severity low, M18) requires exactly this payload extension to carry the milestone terminal status for the #10 archived-head status badge. D5 stays open for its consuming badge-render work but its payload prerequisite is satisfied here — neither orphaned (D5 still tracks the render) nor double-implemented (T91 adds only the payload field, not the badge render). The added `status` field is bounded additive scope on one shape, not an unscoped task.","COVERAGE/SEQUENCING INTACT. Items 16 (T90/D7: gate ArchiveSubsections on !isMilestones — render site App.tsx ~L1193 gated only on showArchive+archivePointers, isMilestones in scope), 17 (T91/D8), 18 (T92), 19 (T93) all still covered. Item 18/T92 vs K13: verified llm/commands/implement/advance.md §3 L103-108 contains the ONLY real `/investigate:start <D>` routing-question creation step to delete, matching K13 (locked) and T92's revised grounding; plan/advance.md (ledger-query worklist) + plan-reviewer.md (report-only defects[]) already conform (verify-no-op), and the Q52/Q53 one-time cleanup is already done with D3-D6 triage preserved on the defect records. Sequencing sound: T90->T91 serialize (same App.tsx archive path); T92 (prompts) + T93 (CSS-only) disjoint and parallel-safe; M21 dependsOn M19."]

Change B (M16) is sound. Change A (M17) needs the fixes below before build. No out-of-scope/pre-existing repo defects found (no `defects` to file).","[HIGHEST RISK] T74: removing the 4-iteration cap leaves the NEW auto-investigate<->replan chain (a cross-command loop: investigate confirms -> seeds goal -> plan replans -> may surface a new defect -> investigate again) WITHOUT concrete termination predicates. T74 acceptance (c) only requires generic 'model-judged ill-loop detection' and points at implement/advance.md L119-130 -- but those three signals (no file changes; criticism repeats without shrinking; same `bun run check` failure recurs) are about a SINGLE worktree's criticism rounds and do NOT translate to the cross-command auto-investigate axis. A cap-free auto-launching loop with no operationally-pinned stop for its NEW axis is a runaway-cost hazard. Fix: T74 acceptance must enumerate concrete ill-loop predicates for the auto-investigate<->replan chain specifically (e.g. the same defect D re-confirmed across rounds with no new fix tasks emitted; investigate returns no adjudicable evidence on two consecutive rounds for the same defect; the goal is re-planned with an identical task set; a defect cycles open->investigated->replanned->open without convergence) -> STOP and file an `open` questions item. 'Remove the cap' is not a stop condition.","T74: the orchestrator's auto-investigate phase is specified to run 'AFTER the per-goal planner<->reviewer round completes', but the plan does not say what happens when the round stops on `awaiting-answers` (rule 4: reviewer new_questions sent the goal back to `clarifying`) WHILE the same review's defects[] bucket was also filed (a go-ahead OR revise review may carry defects[], per plan-reviewer.md L92-95). Does auto-investigate run when the goal is simultaneously parked on user questions? Specify the interaction: either auto-investigate still runs on filed defects (they are orthogonal to the goal's clarification, per plan-advance.md L237-242) or it is deferred. As written the executor must guess.","T73/T74 data-passing is fragile and contradicts the subagent output contract. T73 has plan-advance emit a 'Filed defects for auto-investigate: D<n>' line inside its free-text `### Session summary`, and T74 parses it. But plan-advance.md L257-263 fixes the subagent's machine-readable output to a SINGLE status token on the last line; the Session summary is free prose. String-parsing a prose summary line is brittle. T74 already names the robust alternative ('open defects newly linked goals:<G> with no terminal status') -- make the LEDGER QUERY the primary (authoritative) source of the auto-investigate worklist and demote the summary flag to at most an advisory hint. Adjust T73 acceptance accordingly so it does not mandate a parse-dependent contract.","T72: the new superseding decision should state explicitly that it stands on K8 point 4 (defect-seeded clarify-skip) as well as point 3, because T74/T75's auto-resume path ('skips clarification per K8 pt4') depends on point 4 remaining in force. T72's four required points cover point 3 but do not pin that point 4 is untouched; add a one-line 'K8 points 1,2,4,5 remain in force; only point 3's handoff-direction asymmetry is refined' so the executor does not over-read the supersession.","T78 (verify) inherits the T74 gap: its grep set checks the caps are GONE ('4-iteration|8 rounds|safety ceiling') but has NO positive check that a concrete cross-chain ill-loop/termination criterion was ADDED. Add an acceptance clause to T78 that asserts plan/advance.md contains enumerated auto-investigate stop predicates (not merely the absence of a numeric cap), so removing the cap without adding a real stop cannot pass verification."]

(1 HIGHEST-RISK) T74 pt4 now enumerates concrete cross-chain termination predicates (a-f): once-per-defect-per-round; no-relaunch-without-new-confirmed-evidence; stop+report once a confirmed root cause seeded/extended its goal; park on non-converging open->investigated->replanned->open cycle; park after two consecutive no-adjudicable-evidence rounds; per-pass budget governed by (a)-(e). It explicitly states the generic single-worktree signals do NOT satisfy this. Acceptance (d) restates them as required. Resolved.

(4) T72 now requires the explicit 'K8 points 1,2,4,5 remain in force; only point 3 handoff-direction refined' line and pins that pt4 (defect-seeded clarify-skip) must stay because T74/T75 auto-resume depends on it; pt3's prohibition on investigate running the plan loop inline still stands. Resolved. (5) T78 pt4 adds a POSITIVE stop-predicate presence grep ('caps removed cannot pass without convergence guaranteed'); conjoined with pt3 (caps GONE) it catches the exact targeted regression of caps-removed-but-stop-condition-missing. Resolved.","CONVERGENCE PROOF (crux confirmed): within a plan:advance pass the worklist is the finite set of open defects at auto-investigate-phase entry; predicate (a) processes each at most once; new defects are only filed by the in-round planner<->reviewer loop which completes before the auto-investigate phase runs; predicate (c) halts relaunch once a defect seeds/extends a goal (planning then resumes on that goal, itself bounded by planner<->reviewer convergence); predicates (b)/(d)/(e) force a park-to-user on no-new-evidence / non-convergence / two-consecutive-no-evidence. Each predicate is a ledger-state comparison, so the stop is operationally checkable. The cap-free loop terminates.","BY-POINTER CHECK (T75/T77 do not silently reintroduce summary-parsing or drop a stop condition): T75 binds plan/start.md + follow-up.md to 'mirror plan/advance.md new phase (T-A3)' by pointer to the WHOLE T74 auto-investigate phase (which carries both the ledger-query worklist and the stop predicates) and its acceptance requires running /investigate:advance inline by pointer to that phase, not by re-deriving a worklist from a summary -- so the ledger-query authority and the stop predicates are inherited, not duplicated or weakened. T77 is wording-only, explicitly defers mechanics to T74/T75/T76, correctly keeps investigate->plan handback as file-and-defer (K8 pt3 stands) and keeps implement:* file-and-defer (Q43 names only plan:* as triggers). NON-BLOCKING NOTE for the executor (does not flip the verdict): T75 pt1 phrase 'if the plan-advance subagent flagged filed defects' should be read as the ledger-query existence check (no-op when none filed), NOT a parse of an advisory summary flag -- the binding acceptance and the by-pointer reference to T74's ledger-query phase govern; keep the trigger ledger-query-authoritative when implementing T75 to avoid re-importing the brittle summary contract R31#3 removed. Plan is fine-grained, correctly sequenced (T72 root; T73/T74 depend on it; T75/T77 depend on T74; T78 depends on all M17 tasks; M16 T69/T70->T71 independent), testable (each carries a grep/fetch/`bun run check` acceptance), grounded, and complete against the goal description.

An EXISTING parameterized test in packages/ledger/test/canonical-ledgers.test.ts:332-356 ('divergence guard fires for a hand-edited <name> schema') runs for SIX canonical ledgers (defects/tasks/hypothesis/questions/decisions/goals): it seeds a registry whose entry has a divergent (superset) schema and asserts `await store.init()` REJECTS with /different schema/ under DEFAULT options. After T95 flips the default to backup-and-reinit (no throw on divergence), all six of these assertions INVERT and FAIL. T96's description only says 'add tests' for the new divergence-backup/abort/regression cases and never names this existing suite; its 'REGRESSION' cases cover only no-divergence and empty-dir, NOT this divergence-throw suite. T97 (`bun run check`) will surface the six failures but carries no scoped mandate to rewrite assertions ('resolve any failures introduced by the change' is too vague for what is a deliberate, EXPECTED behavior-change migration, not a defect to debug). FIX: extend T96 (and call it out explicitly) to MIGRATE canonical-ledgers.test.ts:332-356 -- either re-target each of the six cases to construct FsLedgerStore with onSchemaDivergence:'abort' (preserving the rejects-with-/different schema/ assertion, repurposing this suite as the abort-opt-out coverage), OR replace them with the new backup-and-reinit default assertion. Note this existing suite seeds only ledgers.yaml (no on-disk .md ledger file), which is why T94's ENOENT-tolerance on the ledger file is load-bearing -- the migration and T94 must stay consistent on that.","MINOR (planner-fixable, fold into T95): T95's description hedges the re-load mechanism ('re-derive this.registry from the freshly-written registry before the load loop, OR have the helper update this.registry in place'). Since T94's helper already rewrites the registry file via writeRegistry (which serializes this.registry), the helper should authoritatively update this.registry IN PLACE (the single source the load loop at FsLedgerStore.ts:294-334 iterates), and T95's acceptance should PIN that the post-reinit load loop iterates the fresh canonical registry -- not leave the executor a choice that could load stale entries.

Details below.","T103 is built on a symbol that does not exist: there is NO @cq/shared package and NO Zod wire mirror of fetch_ledger's archivePointers[]. The server tool (packages/ledger/src/mcp/ledgerTools.ts:158-163) serialises store.fetch() via plain JSON.stringify with no output schema; the web client (packages/ledger-web/src/mcpClient.ts:116-119) does `JSON.parse(text) as FetchedLedger` with no runtime validation, and its ArchivePointer is a type-only re-export from @cq/ledger (packages/ledger-web/src/types.ts:7-18). Consequently, once T91 adds `status` to the ArchivePointer interface in packages/ledger/src/types.ts:155-162, the field already flows over the wire into the web client — there is NO separate 'wire half' to extend. The goal's own grounding ('the @cq/shared Zod mirror of archivePointers[] is the un-covered half') is factually wrong against the repo. Fix: DROP T103 as redundant, OR re-scope it to the real verifiable gap — an end-to-end round-trip assertion (e.g. extend packages/ledger-web/test/serve.test.ts or a store test) that an archived milestone's `status` survives fetch_ledger from server to client. Either way M26 loses its dependency on a fictitious wire schema.","T104 dependsOn/blockedBy T103, but T104's only real prerequisite is T91 (the ArchivePointer types+server-build data). Since T103 rests on a nonexistent package, T104's dependency chain is contaminated: re-point T104 to dependsOn T91 directly (M26 already dependsOn M21 for T91). T104's render fix itself is correct — passing p.status as milestoneStatus to the archived MilestoneSubsection (packages/ledger-web/src/App.tsx:2002-2008), mirroring the active head (App.tsx:1853, badge gated App.tsx:1659).","T98 leaves a risky either/or (set rootDir:'src' for a flat ./dist/*.js layout, OR realign all entries to ./dist/src/*) for the implementer to resolve at build time. The rootDir:'src' branch carries a concrete, known failure: the ledger tsconfig has include:['src','test'] (packages/ledger/tsconfig.json:10) and tsconfig.base.json sets no rootDir, so setting rootDir:'src' makes tsc emit TS6059 ('File is not under rootDir') for every test/ file unless test inclusion is restructured. Pick the FALLBACK (realign all exports/main to ./dist/src/*) as the PRIMARY approach: it matches the already-correct ./columns entry (package.json:18), requires no tsconfig or test-layout change, and avoids the TS6059 conflict.

(Confirmed against InMemoryLedgerStore.ts:464-497 Phase-1b guard running before Phase-2 at line 500.)","T105 (D9): the root-cause framing ('the client connects before the server confirms listening') is imprecise -- the flaky harness in mcpClient.test.ts:27-58 and displayName.test.ts:49-75 ALREADY runs a GET-based waitForServer readiness probe before McpLedgerClient.connect. The more plausible flake mechanism is the FIXED ports (7793/7795) colliding under concurrency and/or the GET probe returning before the MCP session layer is ready. The proposed fix (ephemeral port + readiness probe) is correct AND already proven in-repo: pty.e2e.test.ts:49-76 implements freePort() (bind :0, read assigned port) + waitForPort() (raw TCP connect). The task should (a) reference that existing precedent to reuse rather than reinvent, (b) prefer the TCP-connect readiness probe over the bare-GET probe, and (c) note freePort()'s bind-then-close TOCTOU window, so binding :0 and reading the port without an intermediate close (or retry-on-EADDRINUSE) avoids merely relocating the race."]

- summary: "T108 is correctly scoped/sequenced/disjoint, but its grounding premise is false for live data: pre-T91 archive pointers carry EMPTY title/status on disk, so the planned rows won't show titles — T108 as written does not fix D12 issue 1."
- new_questions: []
- criticism: ["T108 GROUNDING GAP (blocking): T108 relies on 'the ArchivePointer title + status that T91 landed' to render each archived-milestone row's title + badge. Verified against LIVE data: fetch_ledger('milestones') returns ALL 23 archive pointers (M2..M26) with title:\"\" and status:\"\", and docs/milestones.md persists each `archives:` entry with ONLY id/path/summary — no title/status field. T91 added the fields to the ArchivePointer TYPE and populates them at ARCHIVE TIME going forward, but every PRE-T91 archived milestone on disk lacks them, so fetch_ledger reconstructs empty strings. Consequence: T108's rows would fall back to the bare id (headerLabel logic `p.title.length>0 ? ... : p.id`, App.tsx:1990) and show NO title — which is exactly user-reported D12 issue 1 ('titles never appear'). T108 therefore does NOT achieve D12's stated outcome for the data the user actually sees. The archived .md files DO contain the title (e.g. docs/archive/milestones/M2.md line 5 `title: TUI + web UI improvements`, header `### M2 — done`), so the data is recoverable. FIX the plan: T108 (or a prerequisite task) must backfill / read-side reconstruct ArchivePointer.title+status for legacy pointers (from the archive .md, or a one-shot migration of docs/milestones.md `archives:` entries), so real archived rows show titles. As written this is in the ledger library (FsLedgerStore pointer read / materialiseFetchedLedger), NOT App.tsx — which also breaks T108's 'file is App.tsx only / disjoint from D9/D10/D11' parallel-safety claim, since the real fix touches packages/ledger (the same area as T106's store-abstract.ts).","T108 ACCEPTANCE is a non-reproduction of the user's issue: the happy-dom test as specified ('renders an archived milestone as a single titled row carrying the archived badge') would construct a fake pointer WITH a title and pass, while the real app still shows blank titles for every actual archived milestone. Acceptance must pin the legacy case — assert a row renders the correct title for an archive pointer that, as persisted pre-T91, lacks an inline title (i.e. exercise the backfill/reconstruction path), AND assert the status badge — to genuinely reproduce D12 issue 1.","T108 GROUNDING (minor): the task says 'list each archived milestone as a ROW in the flat ItemTable' but the ItemTable component (App.tsx:1687-1816) receives neither `view.archivePointers` nor `showArchive` nor a lazy-fetch handler — its signature only takes `groups`/`isMilestones`. The task should state that ItemTable's props must be extended (archivePointers + showArchive + an onSelectArchive/fetchArchive callback) and that the archived rows must produce a Row routed to setSelectedArchiveRow (App.tsx:1230-1240, isArchived=true) — the existing flat-milestones <table> renders Items with milestone/id/status/summary columns, which does not map onto an ArchivePointer; specify the row shape."]

- summary: "R95 criticisms 2+3 resolved (acceptance now exercises the T109 backfill; ItemTable wiring fully specified). Criticism 1's residue: T109 mislocates the backfill against the SYNCHRONOUS fetch()/materialiseFetchedLedger contract — its preferred 'read-side reconstruction per fetch' is not implementable as written."
- new_questions: []
- criticism: ["T109 FIX-LOCUS GAP (blocking, grounded): T109 option (a) 'read-side reconstruction in the store's archive-pointer read ... by reading the referenced archive .md at pointer.path ... per fetch' is NOT implementable at the read path that actually produces fetch_ledger('milestones').archivePointers. CONFIRMED against live source: LedgerStore.fetch() is SYNCHRONOUS (LedgerStore.ts:121,130 'reads are sync in-memory unless they touch disk'); FsLedgerStore.fetch() (FsLedgerStore.ts:385-390) returns materialiseFetchedLedger(...) which is a synchronous, FS-free, pure function (InMemoryLedgerStore.ts:570-609) whose archivePointers are just `ledger.archivePointers.map(p=>({...p}))` (line 607). Reading a .md at pointer.path is async I/O and CANNOT happen inside the sync fetch() without either (i) making fetch() async — an interface + ripple change to BOTH adapters and every caller that T109 does NOT scope and that contradicts the documented sync contract — or (ii) backfilling at init() time. FIX the task: name the backfill locus precisely as FsLedgerStore.init() (already async, already reads each archive .md via collectArchivedItems()->fetchArchive(), FsLedgerStore.ts:244-254/432-448), reconstructing title/status from the archive .md (parseArchive already yields the milestone; the `title:` line + `### <id> — <status>` header are available) and CACHING them onto the in-memory ledger.archivePointers so the synchronous fetch() returns them. This is feasible and reuses an existing precedent — but T109 as written points at the wrong boundary (per-fetch read) and is not directly buildable.","T109 MISDIRECTING CANDIDATE LOCUS (planner-fixable): T109 lists 'materialiseFetchedLedger' as a candidate site for the backfill. materialiseFetchedLedger is SHARED with InMemoryLedgerStore (imported by FsLedgerStore from InMemoryLedgerStore.ts) and is synchronous + FS-free; the in-memory adapter has NO pointer.path-on-disk (it stores archive groups in Maps), so a .md read there is impossible and would break the very FsLedgerStore/InMemoryLedgerStore parity that D10/T106 is about. Remove materialiseFetchedLedger from the candidate set and pin the fix to the FS adapter's init-time archive read; state explicitly that the in-memory adapter's archivePointers are populated differently (so the T109 reproduction test must target the FS adapter, or seed an in-memory pointer with title/status directly).","T109 ACCEPTANCE PRECISION (minor, planner-fixable): the reproduction acceptance ('a packages/ledger test ... given an archive pointer persisted WITHOUT inline title/status but WITH an archive .md carrying them, the materialised ArchivePointer carries the reconstructed title+status; FAILS before the fix') is sound ONLY against the FS adapter (which has an on-disk archive .md). Pin the test to FsLedgerStore with a fixture: an `archives:` entry lacking title/status PLUS a docs/archive/milestones/<id>.md carrying `title:` + `### <id> — <status>`, asserting fetch('milestones').archivePointers[i].{title,status} are reconstructed non-empty. Keep the fail-soft assertion (missing/malformed archive .md => empty, no throw)."]

- summary: Plan well-grounded and complete (one task/defect, D13 correctly excluded), but T110's stated fix mechanism would not resolve D16's root cause — revise.
- new_questions: []
- criticism: ["T110 (D16) — the stated fix mechanism does NOT resolve the root cause and would make the (correct, reproduction-first) acceptance test FAIL post-fix. The task says 'drop the isMilestones gate so backfillLegacyArchivePointers runs for every loaded ledger' (FsLedgerStore.ts:401-402). But that method (FsLedgerStore.ts:246-272) reads ptr.path and calls parseMilestoneItemArchive(text) at L260 — which parses the milestones-ledger single-ITEM archive grammar (`### M<n> — <status>` with a `title:` field). For a non-milestones ledger, ptr.path resolves to `./archive/<name>/<id>.md`, a GROUP archive (verified: docs/archive/tasks/M12.md begins `## M12` then `### T50 — done`, carries NO milestone title — only item headlines). parseMilestoneItemArchive on a group-archive file does not extract a milestone title (group.items.length !== 1 / structural mismatch) and fails-soft to title:'' — so titles stay empty and the regression test fails post-fix. The correct fix (which the task's own suggestedFix text gestures at) must source the milestone title/status from the milestones-ledger pointer (already backfilled) OR from docs/archive/milestones/<id>.md keyed by the milestone id — NOT from the per-ledger group archive at ptr.path. T110 must specify reading the milestones-archive item, not merely ungating the existing method, and must preserve InMemory parity (no on-disk archive → no backfill) and the milestones-ledger path.","T114 (D18) — acceptance/fix says 'call answerWith(item) (same handler shape as the detail view)', but no answerWith handler exists in BatchAnswerModal scope. The detail view (App.tsx:2424-2451) uses a local answerWith that sets answer-box state; the batch modal (App.tsx:1392-1481) uses an uncontrolled textarea ref (answerRef) + onSave(row, value). Picking a suggestion in the batch modal must instead populate answerRef.current.value and set answerHasText (or call onSave(row, suggestion) directly). Specify the batch-modal binding so the implementer does not chase a nonexistent handler; also iterate individual suggestion entries (Array.isArray(sv) ? sv : [sv]) rather than the single renderVal <dd> at App.tsx:1435.","T111 (D14) — completeness: the task names 'pty.e2e + the HTTP tests' but freePort() has THREE call sites (test/pty.e2e.test.ts:71, test/displayName.test.ts:56, test/mcpClient.test.ts:38). Name all three explicitly (or confirm a signature-preserving hardening of freePort() that leaves call sites untouched) so the 'all freePort call sites updated' acceptance is unambiguous.","T115 (D19) — minor: acceptance covers the 1-question close case and 'multi-question batches still advance', but D19's suggestedFix prefers recomputing the open set post-save so MID-QUEUE answers shrink the queue / close-on-empty handles a residual snapshot correctly. Add an acceptance clause for the recompute-open-set behavior (not just clamp-then-close on the last index) so a stale batchRows snapshot does not keep a fully-answered queue open."]
