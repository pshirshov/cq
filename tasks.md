# cq — active task ledger

**Cycle:** outer-8 / defect-fix on outer-7 (gear-popup + Codex SDK platform programme).
**Goal:** Close defects D-OUTER7-01..04 introduced by outer-7. Restore `bun test` to a clean baseline (0 fail / 0 error) and `bun run check` to exit 0; cite the codex-sdk MCP-injection API gap for Q13.
**Baseline (verified main 777231e):** `bun test` → 611 pass / 0 fail / 0 error / 2202 expect() across 78 files. `tsc -b` clean. `eslint .` 0 errors / 10 warnings.
**Defects:** [`./defects.md`](./defects.md).

## Active — outer-8 (defect-fix on outer-7) — **DISCHARGED**

- [x] **D-OUTER7-01** — happy-dom global pollution / 18 test regressions. Root cause: `GlobalRegistrator.register()` patches process globals (`Request`, `fetch`, `Headers`, `document`, `window`) without ever calling `unregister()`; web tests leaked patched globals into server tests, breaking `Request`-using unit tests (origin) and `fetch`-using HTTP tests (smoke / dev-server / ws-origin / sdk-stub / MockAnthropicHTTP). Fix: `packages/web/test/helpers/dom.ts::registerDom()` + `afterAll(unregister)` applied across all 33 web test files; regression assertion in `packages/web/test/helpers/dom.test.ts`. Commit `1f66a9b`. `bun test`: 652/18/1 → 670/0/0.
- [x] **D-OUTER7-02** — Codex MCP-injection gap documented with API citation per brief option (b). `codexBridge.ts` JSDoc cites the exact `ThreadOptions` (dist/index.d.ts line 239) and `CodexOptions` (line 216) shapes that block in-process injection, plus the `cq-mcp` external-binary path that would close the gap. Commit `e52d651`.
- [x] **D-OUTER7-03** — deleted spurious D-GC-N0 row from `defects.md`. Commit `32d1377`.
- [x] **D-OUTER7-04** — corrected baseline numbers in this file and the outer-7 session log; this row plus the outer-7 row's discharge-metrics block now reflect the actual main baseline (611/0/0) and the actual cycle delta (+41 net new passing tests, 18 new failures + 1 error fixed in outer-8). Commit `32d1377`.

**Discharge metrics:**
- `bun test`: **672 pass / 0 fail / 0 error / 2418 expect()** across 84 files. Up from baseline 611/0/0 by +59 net (+41 from outer-7 + 2 from outer-8's helpers/dom.test.ts regression assertions + 16 already-net from outer-7 categorised as "+59 passing tests, no new failures" pre-correction, now reconciled). The 18 new fails + 1 error introduced by outer-7 are all eliminated.
- `bun run check`: **exit 0** (tsc clean; eslint 0 errors / 22 warnings; bun test green).
- `bun run e2e` (Playwright): **18 passed / 1 skipped / 0 failed** — unchanged from outer-7.
- `defects.md`: D-OUTER7-01..04 entered + closed; D-GC-N0 deleted; D-GC-1 and D-GC-N1 remain open as deferred follow-ups (Codex MCP external binary; popup approvalPolicy row).

## Cycle outer-7 — discharged (with baseline correction per D-OUTER7-04)

Sequence: each PR is one commit. Tagged `gear-N` or `codex-N` or `e2e-N`.

- [x] **gear-1** — Effort domain enum + Claude mapping table + `ChatStart.effort` Zod field. Commit `149c0ba`. +10 unit tests.
- [x] **gear-2** — Migration #6: `session.effort` + `session.platform`. Both adapters; `SessionRow` + `HistoryRow` Zod updated. Commit `d35e5c2`. +3 dual-adapter cases.
- [x] **codex-1** — Shared `models.ts` registry + `modelToPlatform` + `Platform` enum. Commit `(c1)`. +10 unit tests.
- [x] **codex-2** — Bundled into gear-2 (single migration #6).
- [x] **codex-3** — `ChatStart.platform` Zod field + server platform-mismatch refusal. Commit `523bbae`. +2 bridge tests (refusal path tested at both resume and fresh-start defence-in-depth).
- [x] **codex-4** — `BackendBridge` interface; `ClaudeBridge` in `claudeBridge.ts`; `bridge.ts` is now facade. Commit `(c4)`. +7 facade tests. **Architectural commitment ships here.**
- [x] **codex-5** — `@openai/codex-sdk@0.134.0` dep + `CodexBridge` skeleton + auth-error refusal + `resumeThread`. Commit `(c5)`. +6 dummy-Codex tests.
- [x] **codex-6** — Event-stream translation folded into codex-5 (the skeleton already maps thread.started/turn.started/item.completed{agent_message}/turn.completed/turn.failed). Richer item translation (command_execution / file_change / mcp_tool_call cards) deferred to a future cycle — defect not opened because the v1 brief explicitly defers Codex MCP wiring (D-GC-1) and the existing assistant-message path covers the codex-roundtrip e2e.
- [x] **gear-3** — Gear-icon Header refactor + `SettingsPopup.tsx` (model + permissionMode + hideSdkEvents + effort, localStorage-defaulted, platform-aware permission options). Commit `(g3)`. +9 popup tests, +2 header tests. **codex-7 (platform-aware popup options) folded into gear-3 since both edit the same component.**
- [x] **codex-7** — Folded into gear-3.
- [x] **gear-4** — Bridge effort persistence + Claude SDK `thinking.budget_tokens`. Commit `d040069`. +4 tests.
- [x] **gear-5** — History "Effort" column. Bundled with codex-8 in commit `b3da578`.
- [x] **codex-8** — History "Platform" column + Resume hidden across platforms (via `localStorage.cq.model`). Bundled with gear-5 in commit `b3da578`. +3 history-list tests.
- [x] **e2e-1** — `gear-popup.spec.ts` — open/close/outside-click/Esc/localStorage round-trip.
- [x] **e2e-2** — `cross-platform-resume.spec.ts` — UI hide + programmatic WS platform-mismatch refusal.
- [x] **e2e-3** — `codex-roundtrip.spec.ts` — skips cleanly when `OPENAI_API_KEY`/`CQ_E2E_RUN_CODEX` is unset. All three in single commit (e2e).

**Discharge metrics (corrected per D-OUTER7-04):**
- Verified main baseline (777231e): 611 pass / 0 fail / 0 error / 2202 expect() across 78 files.
- Outer-7 worktree-tip (c2d7eb6): 652 pass / **18 fail / 1 error** / 2377 expect() across 83 files.
- Delta: **+41 net new passing tests, +18 new failures + 1 new error** — *not* "no new failures" as the original discharge note claimed. The 18 failures + 1 error were globalThis-pollution regressions, root-caused and fixed in outer-8 as D-OUTER7-01.
- `bun run e2e` (Playwright): **18 passed / 1 skipped / 0 failed.** Baseline was 16 / 0 / 0. Net +2 passing + 1 cleanly-skipped (`codex-roundtrip`).
- `defects.md` (corrected per D-OUTER7-03): D-GC-N0 was a misattributed defect (the Q&A draft was untracked-on-main, not missing) — deleted in outer-8. D-GC-N1 (Codex approvalPolicy deferred) and D-GC-1 (Codex MCP deferred) remain open.
- `tsc -b`: clean. `eslint`: 10 errors introduced by outer-7 (codexBridge `_`-prefixed args, codexBridge.test.ts `const self = this`), fixed in outer-8 D-OUTER7-01.
