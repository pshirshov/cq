- headline: Pi dispatch path never pins the child's verdict to the cq agent's canonical enum, and no orchestrator-side validation rejects/normalizes off-enum verdicts, so the Pi child model paraphrases the verdict string (e.g. "fail" instead of go-ahead|revise)
- description: "Would be TRUE if ALL hold: (1) the cq plan-review / implement-review agent contract specifies a literal verdict ENUM (go-ahead|revise; approve|disapprove); (2) the Pi-side dispatch-trigger instruction in nix/pkg/cq-assets contexts (pi-context.md, T229) and the dispatch_agent tool's task-passing in nix/pkg/pi-extensions/cq-subagent-dispatch.ts do NOT re-assert that the child must emit the EXACT enum (they ask only for a 'parseable verdict-json'), and/or the parent injects a JSON skeleton with placeholder verdict values the model fills loosely; (3) there is NO orchestrator-side normalization/validation step that maps or rejects a non-enum verdict string before the go-ahead/revise gating logic consumes it."

- headline: D37 root cause = stale pre-T225 cq-subagent-dispatch.ts store path in ~/.pi/agent/settings.json because home-manager activation was not re-run after the T222/T224/T225 merge; re-running activation remediates it
- description: "Known-cause user-action defect: the fix is `home-manager switch` (re-activation), not a repo code change. This round verifies (a) the documented cause and (b) that the user's reported re-deploy (Q143 answer: \"I've redeployed.\") actually remediated it, by direct static inspection of the live environment."
- evidence: ["[correct] ~/.pi/agent/settings.json `extensions[]` now lists `/nix/store/zs2p73sj31k2140y4ylb245wn433wigb-cq-subagent-dispatch.ts` (read 2026-06-08 from the live home-manager-activated file) — i.e. activation regenerated settings.json after the merge, pointing the dispatch extension at a current store path, not the stale pre-T225 one D37 reported.","[correct] `diff /nix/store/zs2p73sj31k2140y4ylb245wn433wigb-cq-subagent-dispatch.ts nix/pkg/pi-extensions/cq-subagent-dispatch.ts` exits 0 (byte-identical, 30452 bytes) — the registered extension is exactly the repo's current MERGED post-T222/T224/T225 source, confirming the stale-path condition no longer holds and the merged extension is what the locally-installed pi now loads (no PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR override needed).","[correct] Q143 (status:answered, author:user) answer = \"I've redeployed.\" — its step (1) is `home-manager switch` annotated \"(RESOLVES D37)\"; the static evidence above confirms that activation took effect."]
