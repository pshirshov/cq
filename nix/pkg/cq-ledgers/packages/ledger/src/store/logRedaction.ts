/**
 * Deterministic secret-redaction for log text.
 *
 * `redactSecrets(text)` applies best-effort pattern matching to replace common
 * credential strings with `[REDACTED:<kind>]` placeholders, where `<kind>`
 * names the matched pattern (see `REDACTION_KINDS`).
 *
 * Caveats:
 *  - **Lossy**: genuine secrets that do not match any pattern are NOT redacted.
 *    Pattern-coverage is best-effort, not exhaustive.
 *  - **Per-line scope**: each regex matches within a single line only (no `.`
 *    crossing newlines). A false positive corrupts only the line it appears on,
 *    and multi-line credentials that would normally span lines are NOT matched.
 *  - **Idempotent**: `redactSecrets(redactSecrets(x)) === redactSecrets(x)`.
 *    Placeholder strings do not match any pattern, so repeated application is
 *    safe.
