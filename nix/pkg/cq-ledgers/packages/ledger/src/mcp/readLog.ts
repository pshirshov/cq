 * FsLedgerStore root, NOT the generic `LedgerStore` interface (no root accessor;
 * its in-memory impl has no filesystem). So the capability is a standalone
 * function type the FS-store layer supplies (closing over its `<root>/docs/logs`)
 * and threads explicitly into the tool factories. Wired over an in-memory store
 * (no filesystem), no capability is supplied and `read_log` throws
 * `ReadLogNotImplementedError`.
