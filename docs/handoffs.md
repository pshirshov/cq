- summary: "/advance run reached DRAINED quiescence (deferred record — written one turn late, once the handoffs ledger went live via plugin reload). Landed: G11 (agent-ergonomic ledger MCP) fully built across 21 tasks (M42-M46 archived) — handoffs ledger + sessionLogs schema, snapshot/reopen_item/unarchive_item/read_log MCP tools + fetch_ledger compact/pagination, web HoldButton hold-to-confirm + sessionLogs viewer, flow-prompt handoff/bootstrap wiring, integration gate. Loop then drained the build's own follow-up defects: G13 fixed D25 (stale eslint-disable), D26 (readLog symlink-escape hardening), D27 (handoff trigger wording) [M48 archived]; G14 fixed D28 (readLog check-then-read TOCTOU) [M50 archived]. All defects D24-D28 resolved; merges 311b8a1 + 537017f; bun run check green 851/0. At stop: P-investigate / P-plan / P-implement all FALSE, no open question gating; goals G10-G14 `planned` and ready for the USER to close (goals never auto-close). Pre-existing M11 left un-archived (dangling open hypothesis H3 under resolved D2). NOTE: a later patch (6aa066b) hardened the stop into a progress-bounded gate after a user-flagged unwarranted stop earlier in the run."

- summary: "/advance run reached quiescence: MIXED (substantial work landed + G15 blocked on one open question). LANDED: (1) user-reported defect D29 (ledger accepted empty/whitespace answer on a question's `answered` transition) investigated→root-caused (H19 backend + H20 frontend, confirmed against source)→defect-seeded G16→planned→BUILT across T162 (backend questions StatusChangePrecondition, dual-store, reproduce-first dual-tests) + T163 (web UX guard) + T164 (TUI UX guard); D29 RESOLVED; M54 archived. (2) During G15 planning, plan-reviewer surfaced a pre-existing fault filed as D30 (scripts/link-prompts.ts + cq-assets/README.md still referenced the removed `llm/` asset root → `bun run link-prompts` silently created 14 dangling .claude/ symlinks); auto-investigated→root-caused (H21)→defect-seeded G17→planned→BUILT across T179 (import-safe refactor + --check + repro) + T180 (repoint LINKS to ../cq-assets/ + harden loop to throw on missing target) + T181 (README de-stale); D30 RESOLVED; M58 archived. All 6 task commits merged to main (HEAD 24c1d51); integrated `bun run check` green 908/0. Investigate milestone M52 archived; fulfilled traceability pointers Q94/Q96 withdrawn. Goals G16 + G17 are `planned` with their work milestones archived — READY FOR THE USER TO CLOSE (set `done`); goals never auto-close. BLOCKED: G15 (the two NEW features the user asked to plan — investigate-flow explorer R/W access + pluggable parallel reviewers via cq.toml/`/cq:reviewers`) is in `clarifying`, its plan emitted+revised (M55/M56, tasks T165-T178, reconciled against review R169) but NOT locked, parked on open question Q95 (confirm reconciliation semantics for the pluggable reviewers — strictest-wins+union-with-source-tags vs majority/primary; the user left the original Q91 answer empty). NEXT: answer Q95 in the TUI/web, then re-run /advance to lock + build G15; and close G16/G17."

- summary: "/advance run (resumed after the user answered Q95) reached DRAINED quiescence. LANDED: G15 — the two NEW features the user asked to plan — fully PLANNED and BUILT this run. Plan stage: Q95 answer (strictest-wins+union reconciliation) folded in, plan re-reviewed (R178 go-ahead), locked (K29), G15 -> planned. Implement stage: all 14 tasks (T165-T178) built across isolated worktrees, adversarially reviewed, autonomously fixed (3 criticism rounds: T175/T176 get_reviewers allowed-tools grant, T178 cq.toml ordering), and merged to main (HEAD f2b69be). FEATURE 1 (M55 archived): investigate-explorer probeRequest contract (T165) + execution-capable investigate-prober agent (Bash + throwaway worktree, read+execute, local-only/no-network) (T166) + prober dispatch wired into investigate/advance.md with harvest-then-discard (T167) + link/README (T168). FEATURE 2 (M56 archived): pi non-interactive spike CONFIRMED (K30 contract: `pi -p --no-tools --no-session --provider/--model`) (T169) + @cq/config cq.toml parser package (T170) + cq-config MCP server (get_reviewers) + Nix package (T171) + dev-llm.nix/.mcp.json registration (T172) + shared /cq:plan-review (T173) & /cq:implement-review (T174) rubrics + strictest-wins+union reconciliation wired into plan/advance.md (T175) & implement/advance.md (T176) + /cq:reviewers session-only override (T177) + cq.toml.example & cq/* links & README (T178). Integrated `bun run check` green 930/1skip/0; `nix build .#cq-config-mcp` verified; `bun run link-prompts` clean with all new asset symlinks resolving. At stop: P-investigate/P-plan/P-implement all FALSE; no open questions (Q88-Q95 answered, Q94/Q96 withdrawn); all defects resolved (D29/D30 this whole run). Goals G15/G16/G17 are `planned` with their work milestones archived — READY FOR THE USER TO CLOSE (set `done`); goals never auto-close. Coordination milestones M51/M53/M57 stay open until their goals are closed; the pre-existing G10-G14 (M37/M39/M40/M47/M49) and M11 are likewise the user's to close.
