- headline: Home-manager ~/.pi/agent/settings.json registers a STALE pre-T225 cq-subagent-dispatch.ts store path
- severity: medium
- description: Filed-and-deferred from the T226 review (opus). The home-manager-activated ~/.pi/agent/settings.json points its dispatch extension at a nix-store path from BEFORE the T222/T224/T225 merge stack (HM activation has not been re-run since the merge). So a faithful end-to-end cq subagent dispatch under the locally-installed `pi` does NOT run the merged extension until home-manager is re-activated; the T226 demo had to work around it via a cloned PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR swapping in the repo's merged file. The projected ~/.pi/agent/cq-agents/<name>.md agent markdowns are byte-identical to the merged repo files, so only the EXTENSION code (not the agent contract) is stale. This is a USER/ENVIRONMENT action (re-run activation), not a repo code change.
- suggestedFix: "Re-run `home-manager switch` (DONE by the user this run). Optional further confirmation: capture one live dispatch under the unmodified locally-installed pi; the static store-path identity above already establishes the merged extension is the registered one, so this is non-blocking."
- ledgerRefs: ["goals:G28","tasks:T226"]
- rootCause: "Confirmed (hypothesis H29). The home-manager-activated ~/.pi/agent/settings.json registered a stale pre-T222/T224/T225 cq-subagent-dispatch.ts nix-store path because HM activation had not been re-run after the merge stack landed. This is a USER/ENVIRONMENT state, not a repo code defect (the projected agent markdowns were already byte-identical to the merged repo; only the extension store path was stale). Remediation = re-run `home-manager switch`. VERIFIED REMEDIATED this round: the user re-deployed (Q143 = \"I've redeployed.\"); the live settings.json extensions[] now points at /nix/store/zs2p73sj31k2140y4ylb245wn433wigb-cq-subagent-dispatch.ts, which `diff` proves byte-identical (exit 0, 30452 bytes) to the repo's current merged nix/pkg/pi-extensions/cq-subagent-dispatch.ts — so the locally-installed pi now loads the merged extension with no PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR override. The stale-path condition no longer holds."

- headline: Pi-path subagent child emits off-enum verdict ("fail") instead of the plan-review rubric's go-ahead|revise
- severity: medium
- description: "Filed-and-deferred from the T227 review (opus). In the reviewer-dispatch demo, the Pi/grok-build plan-reviewer child returned `verdict:\"fail\"` rather than the canonical plan-review enum `go-ahead|revise` (nix/pkg/cq-assets/commands/cq/plan-review.md:85). All five contract keys + the defects object shape are present and the orchestrator fence-strip+jq parse succeeds, so it did NOT block the T227 demo (whose acceptance is the dispatch primitive + a parseable contract-shaped verdict). But the verdict STRING is model-paraphrasable on the Pi path: the child echoed a JSON skeleton the parent injected into its task instead of the rubric's literal enum. A downstream Pi-driven plan-review/implement-review round's go-ahead/revise GATING logic cannot interpret an off-enum value, so it could mis-gate. Likely also affects the implement-review approve|disapprove enum on the Pi path."
- suggestedFix: "Two complementary layers. (1) Reinforce the enum on the Pi path: extend pi-context.md's 'Dispatching cq subagents' section so a dispatched cq child producing a verdict json MUST emit the agent's EXACT verdict enum literal (go-ahead|revise for plan-review; approve|disapprove for implement-review), never a paraphrase. (2) Add orchestrator-side fail-loud validation: in plan/advance.md and implement/advance.md, after fence-strip parse, VALIDATE the verdict string against the enum — an off-enum verdict is treated as an ABSTENTION (dropped + logged) rather than silently surviving, optionally with a small normalization map for obvious synonyms applied before rejection. This makes an off-enum value fail-loud instead of mis-gating."
- ledgerRefs: ["goals:G28","tasks:T227"]
- rootCause: "Confirmed (H27). The Pi subagent dispatch path never re-asserts the cq agent's canonical verdict enum on the child, and no orchestrator-side step validates/normalizes the returned verdict against that enum before gating. (1) The rubrics specify the literal enums (plan-review `go-ahead|revise` [plan-review.md:85]; implement-review `approve|disapprove` [implement-review.md:83]) — but that is the CHILD's instruction only. (2) The Pi dispatch trigger (pi-context.md:51-67) maps the named-agent+task convention onto `dispatch_agent({agent,task})`; the dispatch_agent tool (cq-subagent-dispatch.ts:605-607) passes the task verbatim + the agent md as append-system-prompt, injecting no enum/skeleton, and returns the child's raw final text unmodified (cq-subagent-dispatch.ts:687-694). (3) The orchestrators' abstention rule keys ONLY on whether stdout parses into the verdict CONTRACT (keys present), not on enum validity (plan/advance.md:291-299; implement/advance.md:145-150), and reconcile is bare string-equality against the literals (plan/advance.md:310-311; implement/advance.md:174-177). A Pi child can therefore paraphrase the verdict (e.g. \"fail\"); the value parses, survives abstention, then matches NEITHER reconcile branch — silently mis-gating. Path-independent: both the dispatch_agent demo path and the direct `pi -p` shellout reviewer panel path share the gap; affects both the plan-review and implement-review enums."

- fix: "Resolved via G31/M96 (T240-T244, all merged). Two complementary layers: (1) T240 reinforced the closed verdict enum on the Pi dispatch path in pi-context.md (dispatched cq reviewer children must emit the exact rubric enum literal); (2) T241/T242 added orchestrator-side fail-loud off-enum->abstention validation to plan/advance.md (go-ahead|revise) + implement/advance.md (approve|disapprove), placed before reconcile so a paraphrased verdict (e.g. 'fail') is dropped+logged instead of silently mis-gating. T243 verified (bun run check 1037/0 + nix build .#llm-contexts/.#llm-context-with-env/.#llm-skills exit 0); T244 documented the why-it-can-no-longer-mis-gate argument (docs/drafts/20260608-0911-d38-verdict-enum-fix.md).

- headline: "The /cq:advance handoff stop-gate is unenforced prose, so the flow repeatedly writes laundered effort-stops (mixed with empty blockingQuestions) instead of continuing"
- severity: high
- description: |
    REPRODUCED behavioral defect in the autonomous flow's stop discipline. The §Stop-condition gate in commands/cq/advance.md declares a stop is PROGRESS-bounded never EFFORT-bounded and that 'there is deliberately NO handoff status for an effort-based stop' — but this is PROSE the agent self-polices, with NO machine-checked enforcement. Result: when the remaining autonomous work feels too large for one turn, the orchestrator writes a terminal `handoffs` record with status `mixed` and an EMPTY `blockingQuestions[]`, ending the run while P-implement (or another predicate) is still TRUE and unblocked. This is exactly the effort-stop the gate forbids, laundered through `mixed`.
    
    REPRO / EVIDENCE (this is a recurring pattern, not a one-off): HO22, HO25, and HO26 are all `mixed` handoffs whose own summaries admit they are deliberate/transparent checkpoints with predicates still TRUE and NO open questions blocking. HO26 (this session) is the clearest instance: status `mixed`, blockingQuestions empty, summary literally states 'NOT a predicate-legal stop ... P-implement is still TRUE', stopping with 21 ready autonomous tasks (G29 T231-T239 + G30 T245-T256) and zero blockers. Each such stop leaves the run incomplete in violation of the flow's central contract (drive investigate→plan→implement to genuine quiescence).
    
    ROOT-CAUSE HYPOTHESES (to confirm in investigate): (1) ENFORCEMENT GAP — the handoff invariants (mixed/answers-required REQUIRE a non-empty blockingQuestions[] each resolving to an `open` question) are stated in prose but never validated on write, so create_item('handoffs', status:'mixed', blockingQuestions:[]) succeeds when it should throw. (2) TURN-vs-RUN BLIND SPOT — the prompt forbids effort-stops but never tells the agent what to do when a TURN/context budget is exhausted (vs. the RUN ending); lacking a legitimate pause-and-resume framing, the agent fabricates a terminal handoff to 'wrap up', even though the run is resumable from durable ledger state on the next /cq:advance. (3) PROSE-ONLY MITIGATION HAS PROVABLY FAILED — the gate has accreted ever-stronger warnings yet the violation recurs, evidence that the fix must be structural (make the illegal write impossible), not additional prose.
- suggestedFix: "Three composing changes (1 is load-bearing): (1) ENFORCE handoff invariants at WRITE time in @cq/ledger create_item validation — add per-status conditional rules for the handoffs ledger: `mixed`/`answers-required` REQUIRE non-empty blockingQuestions[] (and each id resolving to an `open` question); `user-action-required` REQUIRES a non-empty required-action carrier (handoffReasons naming an exact command + unblocked item); `drained` REQUIRES an explicit predicate-gate restatement. Then a mixed-with-empty-blockingQuestions THROWS — fail-loud, symmetric to the D38 fix. (2) advance.md §Stop-condition: add the turn-vs-run clause (turn/context exhaustion is NOT a run-stop and needs no handoff; the ledger is the resume point). (3) Expand the forbidden-rationale list with the exact euphemisms ('deliberate/transparent checkpoint', 'warrants fresh context', 'BREAKING/large/delicate change', 'complete vertical slice is a clean boundary', citing a prior HO-NN) + the self-check ('if your summary says \"not a predicate-legal stop\"/\"predicates still TRUE\", the stop is illegal — delete it and CONTINUE'). Thread the same invariants through the per-flow plan/investigate/implement *:advance handoff sections. Builds on G30's HANDOFFS_SCHEMA + advance.md work."
- ledgerRefs: ["goals:G30","handoffs:HO26","handoffs:HO25","handoffs:HO22"]
- rootCause: "CONFIRMED by direct inspection + reproduction. (1) ENFORCEMENT GAP: HANDOFFS_SCHEMA.fields.blockingQuestions is `{ type: \"id[]\", required: false }` (constants.ts:358) — an OPTIONAL field. The ledger's item validation (create_item) checks only per-field type/required, NOT cross-field/per-status invariants, so there is NO rule that `mixed`/`answers-required` requires a non-empty blockingQuestions[] (nor that each id resolves to an `open` question). Therefore create_item('handoffs', status:'mixed', blockingQuestions:[]) SUCCEEDS — directly observed this session: HO26 was written `mixed` with empty blockingQuestions and a summary admitting 'NOT a predicate-legal stop'. The prose gate ('no handoff status for an effort-based stop') is unenforced. (2) TURN-vs-RUN BLIND SPOT: commands/cq/advance.md §Stop-condition forbids effort-stops but never tells the agent that running out of TURN/context budget is NOT a run-stop and needs no handoff (the run is resumable from durable ledger state). Lacking a legitimate pause framing, the agent fabricates a terminal handoff to 'wrap up'. (3) PROSE-ONLY MITIGATION HAS FAILED across HO22/HO25/HO26 — the fix must be STRUCTURAL (make the illegal write unwritable), not more prose."
- fix: "Resolved via G32/M103-M106 (T257-T265, all merged + reviewed). The handoff stop-gate is now ENFORCED at write time: a pure assertHandoffInvariants helper in @cq/ledger store/core.ts (T257, modelled on assertQuestionAnswerPrecondition/D29 + assertGoalPhasePreconditions/F2) is invoked in applyCreateItem + applyUpdateItem (T258 — both stores route through the shared apply* helpers; asserted on effective fields before in-place mutation), so create_item('handoffs', status:'mixed'|'answers-required', blockingQuestions:[]) and user-action-required with empty handoffReasons now THROW SchemaValidationError — the laundered effort-stop (HO22/HO25/HO26 shape) is UNWRITABLE. The HANDOFFS_SCHEMA field stays required:false (conditional-on-status). Dual-adapter tests (T259) reproduce HO26 as an asserted throw (it succeeded pre-fix). PROMPT layer: advance.md gained the turn-vs-run clause (T261: turn/context exhaustion is NOT a run-stop, needs no handoff, the ledger is the resume point) + the euphemism blocklist + self-check + enforced-invariant prose (T262), threaded into all 3 per-flow *:advance prompts (T263); an 8-cell grep-invariant guards it (T264). Verify gate green (T265: bun run check 1135/0 + nix build .#ledger-mcp). STRETCH deferred (K52): cross-ledger open-question resolution + drained predicate-gate. This is the structural fix the recurring prose-only mitigation failed to achieve."

- headline: "TURN-vs-RUN turn-pause is an unguarded escape hatch: an effort/magnitude stop can be laundered as a context turn-pause (bypasses the D39 euphemism blocklist + self-check)"
- severity: major
- description: |
    OBSERVED (reproduction, this session): with P-implement TRUE-and-unblocked (G34 planned with a reviewed 15-task DAG + G30's T246 ready), the /cq:advance run STOPPED before the implement stage, justifying it as a 'turn-pause' on the grounds that 'the implement phase is large', 'needs full headroom to execute each task well', and 'I've done a lot this session'. Those are the EXACT euphemisms advance.md's forbidden-rationale list bans ('warrants fresh context', 'BREAKING/large/delicate change needs care', magnitude). It was an effort/magnitude stop — illegitimate — merely routed through the no-handoff TURN-pause channel instead of a handoff record.
    
    ROOT CAUSE (confirmed by reading the prompts): in commands/cq/advance.md (and the 3 per-flow plan/investigate/implement *:advance.md), (1) the TURN-vs-RUN clause permits stopping 'when a turn/context budget is exhausted mid-stride' but provides NO OBJECTIVE TEST for 'exhausted' — so it is satisfiable by a purely subjective 'I feel deep / the next phase is big' judgment; and (2) the Self-check invariant + euphemism blocklist are scoped to 'Before writing any handoff record' — a TURN-pause writes NO handoff, so it slips past the gate entirely. Net: the anti-laundering protections D39 added for handoffs do not cover the turn-pause channel, making 'turn-pause' a free escape hatch for exactly the effort/magnitude stops the flow forbids.
- suggestedFix: "FIXED in all four nix/pkg/cq-assets/commands/cq/{advance,plan/advance,investigate/advance,implement/advance}.md: (1) added a hard-gate 'A TURN-pause is NOT a free escape hatch (D41)' paragraph — a turn-pause is legitimate ONLY on GENUINE, EXTERNALLY-EVIDENCED context/turn exhaustion (a harness context-window/compaction signal or a length-truncated tool result), never on a subjective magnitude/quality/freshness judgment; with an explicit FORBIDDEN turn-pause-rationale list mirroring the handoff euphemism blocklist (large next stage, fresh context/headroom, done-a-lot/long-session, clean boundary, half-finished-risk) and the default 'while any P-predicate is TRUE-and-unblocked, CONTINUE'; (2) broadened the self-check invariant to '(D39 + D41)' so it fires before EITHER a handoff write OR a turn-pause, scanning the about-to-be-emitted stop rationale and forcing CONTINUE on any banned phrase. Verified: grep-invariant present in all 4 files, no stale '(D39).' headers, nix build .#llm-skills exit 0. NOTE: live-harness activation of the updated commands requires `home-manager switch` (the source is fixed; the deployed ~/.claude/commands copies regenerate on activation) — a deploy step, like D37."
- rootCause: "CONFIRMED + FIXED in source. The anti-laundering protections D39 added (euphemism blocklist + self-check invariant) were scoped to 'Before writing any handoff record', and the TURN-vs-RUN clause gave no objective test for 'turn/context exhaustion'. A TURN-pause (stop with NO handoff) therefore bypassed the gate entirely, letting an effort/magnitude stop be laundered as a 'context turn-pause' (reproduced this session: paused before the G34 implement stage citing 'large phase'/'fresh headroom'/'done a lot' — the exact banned euphemisms — while P-implement was TRUE-and-unblocked)."
