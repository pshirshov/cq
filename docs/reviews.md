- criticism: ["T27 mis-grounds summarize() as a shared util: it is duplicated VERBATIM in packages/ledger-tui/src/app.tsx:63 and packages/ledger-web/src/App.tsx:110 (both bodies: f[\"headline\"] ?? f[\"title\"] ?? f[\"question\"] ?? f[\"summary\"] ?? Object.values(f)[0]). T27's description assumes one shared location and its acceptance only names happy-dom WEB tests. The TUI copy ALSO falls through to the long criticism string[] for legacy reviews and needs the same truncate-first-criticism fallback. Fix: scope BOTH summarize() copies in T27 (or split a TUI-summarize subtask), and add an ink-testing-library assertion that a legacy review with no summary renders a truncated single line in the TUI, not the full joined criticism. As written, Req5 is only half-delivered for the TUI.","T34 bundles an objective automated gate (bun run check) with five manual observed-vs-expected smoke checks into one mega-task; the manual halves are not independently verifiable. Where feasible, fold each request's verification into the per-task acceptance tests it already owns (T30/T31/T32/T33/T27 each name happy-dom or ink tests) and reduce T34 to the green-check gate plus any cross-cutting regression assertion, rather than a manual five-point sweep.","T26 acceptance overstates the canonical-ledgers test: that test (packages/ledger/test/canonical-ledgers.test.ts) does NOT assert an exact reviews field-SET — it exercises specific fields plus a schema-divergence guard across docs/ledgers.yaml + examples/sample-ledger + the lib constant. Adding optional summary keeps it green but is not 'verified' by it. Either add an explicit assertion that REVIEWS_SCHEMA.fields.summary exists (type string, required:false) and that all three registry copies declare it, or reword T26's acceptance to claim only divergence-guard parity, not field-set assertion."]

- new_questions: []
- criticism: ["T37 (and the T35 decision lock) under-specify the investigation->planning handoff and conflate two incompatible mechanisms. T37 acceptance says on a confirmed root cause /investigate:advance should 'HAND OFF to plan-flow ... then the standard plan-advance<->plan-reviewer cycle produces reviewed fix tasks'. But /plan:advance (llm/commands/plan/advance.md) IS itself a command whose body runs the planner<->reviewer loop by spawning plan-advance/plan-reviewer subagents; a command cannot invoke another command's loop. So 'run the cycle' resolves to EITHER (a) /investigate:advance re-implements the plan loop inline (duplicates the loop that already lives in /plan:advance, and contradicts the Q26 file-and-defer integration principle the rest of the plan adopts), OR (b) it writes rootCause/suggestedFix, creates/extends the goal, and DEFERS to the user to run /plan:advance. The plan must pick (b) explicitly (consistent with Q26 file-and-defer + resumability) and state it in both T35's locked decision and T37's acceptance; as written the executor could build either.","T37/T35 do not specify the clarify-skip for the seeded goal. Q25 hands a defect with an ALREADY-confirmed root cause to plan-flow, but /plan:start and /plan:follow-up both re-open the goal to `clarifying` and spawn plan-advance for a FRESH clarifying round (llm/commands/plan/{start,follow-up}.md). Re-clarifying a defect whose root cause is confirmed is redundant. The handoff task must state how the seeded goal enters planning without a wasted clarifying round (e.g. seed the goal description with the confirmed root cause + suggestedFix so plan-advance has nothing left to clarify, or document that the planner may skip clarification when the goal is defect-seeded). Currently neither T35 nor T37 addresses this, leaving the executor to guess.","Cross-milestone dependency on the #1 follow-up (M6) is unstated and risks a same-file conflict. T42 edits implement-reviewer.md's returned-JSON contract to add `defects[]`, and its description asserts the contract 'currently' carries 'taskId/verdict/criticism/questions/rationale, plus the `summary` from the #1 follow-up'. But M6/T28 (the task that adds `summary` to that exact JSON contract) is still `planned`, and M8 dependsOn M7 ONLY (not M6). If M8 runs before M6/T28, T42's stated premise is false and two tasks edit the same JSON block in implement-reviewer.md independently. Either add M6 (or T28) to T42/M8's dependsOn, or reword T42 so its acceptance does not presuppose the `summary` field already exists (state the defects[] addition is independent of the summary work). Same applies to T40/T28 both editing plan-reviewer.md.","T44 acceptance is not operationally verifiable, repeating the defect R3 already flagged on the old T34. Its acceptance is 'A short written audit (in the task completion / PR description) confirming the closed loop ... with any drift corrected' plus 'no contradictory routing language remains' - a subjective prose deliverable, not a checkable command/invariant. The only mechanical clause is `bun run check` green (which a markdown-only consistency task cannot actually exercise for routing correctness). Tighten the acceptance to a verifiable form: e.g. a grep-able invariant (every fix task references `defects:` in ledgerRefs; no prompt instructs implement to execute a defect directly; the `[correct]`/`[incorrect]` evidence convention string appears identically in investigate-explorer + investigate/advance), so the audit's conclusion rests on enumerable checks rather than a narrative."]

Three under-specified acceptances need tightening before build (below).","T65/T66 (#7 title seam) is under-specified about HOW the displayName reaches the client. Verified: buildServer(store) constructs `new McpServer(SERVER_INFO,{instructions})` where SERVER_INFO is a module constant {name,version} and buildServer receives only `store`, NOT cwd (packages/ledger-mcp/src/main.ts L49,L183-190); the server.ts the planner could not find does not exist (main.ts is the wiring). To surface basename(--cwd), T65 must thread `cwd` into buildServer/attachMcpHttp AND into the embedded TUI (in-memory transport) and embedded web (co-hosted /mcp) hosts that call them. The MCP Implementation/serverInfo type carries only name/version/title, so the displayName must ride in name/title or in `instructions`; T66's McpLedgerClient must read it via the SDK (client.getServerVersion()/getInstructions()). Add to T65 acceptance: cwd is threaded into buildServer and the basename rides a NAMED carrier (serverInfo.title or instructions). Add to T66: the real client reads that exact carrier (not just the fake).","T54 (#4 array-editor delimiter) defers the id[] delimiter decision to the implementer ('id[] only if it does not regress ... choose one rule and apply identically'). dependsOn/blockedBy are id[] (COMMON_REF_FIELDS) and existing multi-id entry/tests may rely on comma-splitting. The plan must DECIDE the id[] rule (lowest-risk: keep comma for id[], switch only string[] to semicolon/newline) rather than leaving 'choose one rule' inside the task - that is an unscoped decision embedded in a task.","T55 (#4 one-shot normalize) declares dependsOn:T54 but the normalize must split existing array ELEMENTS directly (each element on semicolons/newlines) to stay idempotent and independent of T54's editor-parser change; re-running update_item through a parseFieldValue that now also splits could double-process or behave inconsistently. Make T55's description explicit that it operates on stored array elements, not by re-invoking the editor parse path, so its asserted idempotence holds."]

No new defects, no out-of-scope faults. Verification detail follows.","R29 #1 RESOLVED (T65/T66, #7 title seam). Confirmed against packages/ledger-mcp/src/main.ts: buildServer(store) at L183 takes ONLY store (no cwd); SERVER_INFO={name,version} module const at L49; the referenced server.ts does not exist (main.ts is the wiring). T65 now threads cwd/displayName into buildServer and ALL four real call sites: stdio (L366), attachMcpHttp's inner buildServer (L258), embedded TUI in-memory host (packages/ledger-tui/src/mcpClient.ts L81, where embedded(cwd) already has cwd in scope), and embedded web co-hosted /mcp (packages/ledger-web/src/serve.ts via attachMcpHttp).

G2 follow-up #4 plan (M21: T90-T93, defects D7/D8) maps all four items 16/17/18/19, is correctly sequenced, and is well-grounded against source on items 16/17/18; two planner-fixable nits below. VERIFIED CORRECT: #16/T90 — ArchiveSubsections render site (App.tsx L1193) is gated only on showArchive+archivePointers, NOT on isMilestones (which IS in scope, L1232/L1246/L1258); adding `&& !isMilestones` is surgical and preserves the T79 unification for non-milestones (renderer at L1916-2019, tested app.test.tsx L688-722). #17/T91 — active head uses ms.title (L1847) vs archived head uses p.summary=description (L2000); fix is real. #18/T92 vs K13 — only implement/advance.md §3 (L103-108) actually contains a `/investigate:start <D>` routing-question step to DELETE; plan/advance.md (LEDGER-QUERY worklist L87-98, no routing-question) and plan-reviewer.md (defects[] report-only, L62-78) ALREADY conform, and T92's acceptance correctly treats those two as confirm/guard. One-time cleanup confirmed: Q52/Q53 withdrawn with full D3-D6 triage preserved on the defect records — no information loss, non-blocking file-and-defer retained. T92/T93 (prompts/CSS) are disjoint from T90→T91 (same App.tsx archive path) and parallel-safe; M21 dependsOn M19 is appropriate.","T93 (item 19) is mis-grounded: its description tells the implementer to 'tune the existing .lw-batch* rules' (width/max-width, height/max-height, font-size on `.lw-batch` / `.lw-batch-body`), but packages/ledger-web/src/styles.css (full 763-line file) contains NO `.lw-batch`, `.lw-batch-body`, or `.lw-batch-nav` rule at all. The batch modal (T63, done, commit e677b77) reused the HelpOverlay backdrop pattern; `.lw-batch` exists only as a MARKER class on the dialog element (app.test.tsx L1039 queries q('.lw-batch')) with no CSS rule backing it, and `.lw-batch-body`/`.lw-batch-nav` classes are unconfirmed anywhere (no test references them). Re-ground T93: state the work is to ADD/define `.lw-batch*` sizing rules (not 'tune' pre-existing ones), and confirm against the actual BatchAnswerModal markup which element(s) carry the box/body/nav classes the rules must target. The acceptance (assert width/height/font-size resolve to the new values via computed style or the literal CSS rule) is otherwise operational and survives the fix.","T91 (item 17) acceptance under-specifies the collapsed-head case and so does not truly leave the title-source mechanism free. Archived sections default COLLAPSED and lazy-fetch their group content (ArchiveSubsections App.tsx L1939-1981; app.test.tsx L724-754). The lazy-content option (deriving title from c.milestone.title) only populates AFTER first expand — so a COLLAPSED archived head built that way would show p.id or p.summary (description), NOT the title. The acceptance 'an archived section head displays the milestone title' is satisfiable on a collapsed head ONLY by the ArchivePointer-payload option (add `title` to the pointer; App.tsx L1932 + packages/ledger/src/types.ts ArchivePointer @ L155 + the server build). Pin the acceptance to assert the title shows on a COLLAPSED (un-expanded) archived head, which effectively forces the payload-extension path rather than leaving it 'implementer's choice'. NON-BLOCKING NOTE (not a new defect): open defect D5 already proposes adding the milestone STATUS to the same ArchivePointer/archive-group payload over MCP — coordinating T91's `title` extension with D5's `status` on the one ArchivePointer shape change would avoid two boundary edits; D5 stays deferred."]

The acceptance (assert width/height/font-size resolve to the new values + body scroll, via computed style or the literal CSS rule under happy-dom) is operational and survives the re-grounding.","R73 #2 RESOLVED (T91 / item 17).

The revised T91 now states the title-source mechanism is NOT implementer's choice — it MUST extend the ArchivePointer payload (add `title` to types.ts + populate it in the server's archivePointer build, then use p.title) — and pins the acceptance to a COLLAPSED (un-expanded) archived head showing the milestone `title` (not description). This is satisfiable on a collapsed head ONLY via the payload extension (lazy c.milestone.title would not be populated pre-expand), so the acceptance genuinely forces the right path.","D5 COORDINATION COHERENT (T91). T91 now lands BOTH `title` (its own item 17 / D8 fix) and `status` (D5's prerequisite) in ONE ArchivePointer-payload + server-build edit; T91 ledgerRefs now include defects:D5. Verified D5 (open, severity low, M18) requires exactly this payload extension to carry the milestone terminal status for the #10 archived-head status badge. D5 stays open for its consuming badge-render work but its payload prerequisite is satisfied here — neither orphaned (D5 still tracks the render) nor double-implemented (T91 adds only the payload field, not the badge render). The added `status` field is bounded additive scope on one shape, not an unscoped task.","COVERAGE/SEQUENCING INTACT.

Item 18/T92 vs K13: verified llm/commands/implement/advance.md §3 L103-108 contains the ONLY real `/investigate:start <D>` routing-question creation step to delete, matching K13 (locked) and T92's revised grounding; plan/advance.md (ledger-query worklist) + plan-reviewer.md (report-only defects[]) already conform (verify-no-op), and the Q52/Q53 one-time cleanup is already done with D3-D6 triage preserved on the defect records.

The more plausible flake mechanism is the FIXED ports (7793/7795) colliding under concurrency and/or the GET probe returning before the MCP session layer is ready. The proposed fix (ephemeral port + readiness probe) is correct AND already proven in-repo: pty.e2e.test.ts:49-76 implements freePort() (bind :0, read assigned port) + waitForPort() (raw TCP connect). The task should (a) reference that existing precedent to reuse rather than reinvent, (b) prefer the TCP-connect readiness probe over the bare-GET probe, and (c) note freePort()'s bind-then-close TOCTOU window, so binding :0 and reading the port without an intermediate close (or retry-on-EADDRINUSE) avoids merely relocating the race."]

- new_questions: []
- criticism: ["T108 GROUNDING GAP (blocking): T108 relies on 'the ArchivePointer title + status that T91 landed' to render each archived-milestone row's title + badge. Verified against LIVE data: fetch_ledger('milestones') returns ALL 23 archive pointers (M2..M26) with title:\"\" and status:\"\", and docs/milestones.md persists each `archives:` entry with ONLY id/path/summary — no title/status field. T91 added the fields to the ArchivePointer TYPE and populates them at ARCHIVE TIME going forward, but every PRE-T91 archived milestone on disk lacks them, so fetch_ledger reconstructs empty strings. Consequence: T108's rows would fall back to the bare id (headerLabel logic `p.title.length>0 ? ... : p.id`, App.tsx:1990) and show NO title — which is exactly user-reported D12 issue 1 ('titles never appear'). T108 therefore does NOT achieve D12's stated outcome for the data the user actually sees. The archived .md files DO contain the title (e.g. docs/archive/milestones/M2.md line 5 `title: TUI + web UI improvements`, header `### M2 — done`), so the data is recoverable. FIX the plan: T108 (or a prerequisite task) must backfill / read-side reconstruct ArchivePointer.title+status for legacy pointers (from the archive .md, or a one-shot migration of docs/milestones.md `archives:` entries), so real archived rows show titles. As written this is in the ledger library (FsLedgerStore pointer read / materialiseFetchedLedger), NOT App.tsx — which also breaks T108's 'file is App.tsx only / disjoint from D9/D10/D11' parallel-safety claim, since the real fix touches packages/ledger (the same area as T106's store-abstract.ts).","T108 ACCEPTANCE is a non-reproduction of the user's issue: the happy-dom test as specified ('renders an archived milestone as a single titled row carrying the archived badge') would construct a fake pointer WITH a title and pass, while the real app still shows blank titles for every actual archived milestone. Acceptance must pin the legacy case — assert a row renders the correct title for an archive pointer that, as persisted pre-T91, lacks an inline title (i.e. exercise the backfill/reconstruction path), AND assert the status badge — to genuinely reproduce D12 issue 1.","T108 GROUNDING (minor): the task says 'list each archived milestone as a ROW in the flat ItemTable' but the ItemTable component (App.tsx:1687-1816) receives neither `view.archivePointers` nor `showArchive` nor a lazy-fetch handler — its signature only takes `groups`/`isMilestones`. The task should state that ItemTable's props must be extended (archivePointers + showArchive + an onSelectArchive/fetchArchive callback) and that the archived rows must produce a Row routed to setSelectedArchiveRow (App.tsx:1230-1240, isArchived=true) — the existing flat-milestones <table> renders Items with milestone/id/status/summary columns, which does not map onto an ArchivePointer; specify the row shape."]

CONFIRMED against live source: LedgerStore.fetch() is SYNCHRONOUS (LedgerStore.ts:121,130 'reads are sync in-memory unless they touch disk'); FsLedgerStore.fetch() (FsLedgerStore.ts:385-390) returns materialiseFetchedLedger(...) which is a synchronous, FS-free, pure function (InMemoryLedgerStore.ts:570-609) whose archivePointers are just `ledger.archivePointers.map(p=>({...p}))` (line 607). Reading a .md at pointer.path is async I/O and CANNOT happen inside the sync fetch() without either (i) making fetch() async — an interface + ripple change to BOTH adapters and every caller that T109 does NOT scope and that contradicts the documented sync contract — or (ii) backfilling at init() time. FIX the task: name the backfill locus precisely as FsLedgerStore.init() (already async, already reads each archive .md via collectArchivedItems()->fetchArchive(), FsLedgerStore.ts:244-254/432-448), reconstructing title/status from the archive .md (parseArchive already yields the milestone; the `title:` line + `### <id> — <status>` header are available) and CACHING them onto the in-memory ledger.archivePointers so the synchronous fetch() returns them. This is feasible and reuses an existing precedent — but T109 as written points at the wrong boundary (per-fetch read) and is not directly buildable.","T109 MISDIRECTING CANDIDATE LOCUS (planner-fixable): T109 lists 'materialiseFetchedLedger' as a candidate site for the backfill. materialiseFetchedLedger is SHARED with InMemoryLedgerStore (imported by FsLedgerStore from InMemoryLedgerStore.ts) and is synchronous + FS-free; the in-memory adapter has NO pointer.path-on-disk (it stores archive groups in Maps), so a .md read there is impossible and would break the very FsLedgerStore/InMemoryLedgerStore parity that D10/T106 is about. Remove materialiseFetchedLedger from the candidate set and pin the fix to the FS adapter's init-time archive read; state explicitly that the in-memory adapter's archivePointers are populated differently (so the T109 reproduction test must target the FS adapter, or seed an in-memory pointer with title/status directly).","T109 ACCEPTANCE PRECISION (minor, planner-fixable): the reproduction acceptance ('a packages/ledger test ... given an archive pointer persisted WITHOUT inline title/status but WITH an archive .md carrying them, the materialised ArchivePointer carries the reconstructed title+status; FAILS before the fix') is sound ONLY against the FS adapter (which has an on-disk archive .md). Pin the test to FsLedgerStore with a fixture: an `archives:` entry lacking title/status PLUS a docs/archive/milestones/<id>.md carrying `title:` + `### <id> — <status>`, asserting fetch('milestones').archivePointers[i].{title,status} are reconstructed non-empty.

Revise.
- new_questions: []
- criticism: ["BLOCKING (T119 / transition-legality): Q67's LOCKED transition map (verified at constants.ts:110-116 today = [open,wip,blocked,resolved,abandoned]; target per Q67 = open->{wip,resolved,wontfix}; root-caused reachable ONLY from wip) has NO open->root-caused edge. The current investigate flow (llm/commands/investigate/advance.md step 5a) NEVER sets the defect's STATUS — the lifecycle lives entirely on the hypothesis tree (status open|uncertain|confirmed|wrong); rootCause is written as the narrative cause + citations, not a marker. So T119's instruction 'a confirmed root cause sets defect STATUS = root-caused' will, for a defect still in status=open, throw InvalidTransitionError against the server's strict transition guard. FIX T119: instruct investigate to move the defect open->wip when it begins investigating (step 1/3), so the file-and-defer path is open->wip->root-caused (both edges legal per Q67). State this explicitly in T119's description and acceptance.","T120 OVER-BROAD RE-KEY (grounded, planner-fixable): 'confirmed node'/'confirmed root cause' in plan/advance.md predicates (b)/(c)/(d) (verified llm/commands/plan/advance.md:150-164) refers to the HYPOTHESIS-TREE `confirmed` status + `[correct]` evidence — the investigate adjudication and ill-loop/convergence detector — NOT a defect rootCause marker and NOT the defect lifecycle. T120's instruction to 're-key every reference to confirmed node/confirmed root cause to status==root-caused' would corrupt those hypothesis-tree stop predicates. Scope the re-key to the DEFECT-STATUS worklist gate only (plan/advance.md:92-98 worklist + plan-advance.md:248-249, currently keyed on status:open; new: include open/wip/inconclusive as actionable, EXCLUDE root-caused/resolved/wontfix), and explicitly PRESERVE the hypothesis-tree confirmed/[correct]-evidence vocabulary in predicates (b)/(c)/(d). T120's acceptance already gets the worklist semantics right; the description's blanket 'confirmed node->root-caused' is the wrong instruction.","MISSED #4A TOUCH-POINT (under-scoped): implement/advance.md:198 (Milestone completion) states defect terminal = `resolved`/`abandoned`. The locked set renames abandoned->wontfix, so this line will reference a removed status. No task covers it — T121 targets only the reviewer-filed-defects section (lines 96-117). Add implement/advance.md:198 (and any other `abandoned` defect-terminal reference in that file) to T121's (or T128's) edit scope.","T121 PREMISE OVERSTATED (minor, planner-fixable): implement/advance.md:96-117 already files reviewer defects with status:open and fields {headline,description,severity,suggestedFix?} — it writes NO rootCause marker. There is no 'CONFIRMED/UNKNOWN in rootCause' instruction to remove, so T121 as written sends the implementer hunting for a nonexistent marker. Correct T121's description: its real content is (a) confirm status=open + no removed status, and (b) fix the abandoned->wontfix reference at line 198 (per the criticism above).","T127 COMPLETENESS (minor): implement/advance.md:36 reads 'at most N = 4 workers ... (configurable — treat 4 as the default ready-batch size)'. T127's acceptance ('no remaining N = 4') must also bump the parenthetical 'treat 4 as the default' to 8, else a stale 4 survives.","T116 INTERNAL CONTRADICTION (minor): the description first lists open: [wip, root-caused, inconclusive, resolved, wontfix] then says 'follow Q67 verbatim: open->{wip, resolved, wontfix}'. The acceptance pins 'Q67 exactly' (open has NO ->root-caused/->inconclusive edge), so drop the contradictory first listing from the description to prevent the implementer encoding the wrong edge set."]

- summary: "All 6 R111 criticisms resolved against live source: T119 makes open->wip explicit (file-and-defer path open->wip->root-caused, Q67-legal); T120 surgically scopes the re-key to the defect-STATUS worklist/seed-gate (plan/advance.md:92-98 + plan-advance.md:248-249) and preserves the hypothesis-tree confirmed/[correct] predicates at :150-164; T121 covers abandoned->wontfix at implement/advance.md:198 and corrects the false rootCause-marker premise (reviewer defects stay status:open); T127 bumps both N=4 and the 'default ready-batch size 4' parenthetical to 8; T116 drops the contradictory open-edge listing and encodes Q67 verbatim (add root-caused+inconclusive, drop blocked, rename abandoned->wontfix) with T122 migrating live blocked/abandoned defects. Plan T116-T129 across M33/M31/M32 (M31 dependsOn M33) is fine-grained, sequenced, testable, grounded, complete, and faithful to Q55-Q72. Go-ahead."

- summary: Plan well-grounded and complete (one task/defect, D13 correctly excluded), but T110's stated fix mechanism would not resolve D16's root cause — revise.
- new_questions: []
- criticism: ["T110 (D16) — the stated fix mechanism does NOT resolve the root cause and would make the (correct, reproduction-first) acceptance test FAIL post-fix. The task says 'drop the isMilestones gate so backfillLegacyArchivePointers runs for every loaded ledger' (FsLedgerStore.ts:401-402). But that method (FsLedgerStore.ts:246-272) reads ptr.path and calls parseMilestoneItemArchive(text) at L260 — which parses the milestones-ledger single-ITEM archive grammar (`### M<n> — <status>` with a `title:` field). For a non-milestones ledger, ptr.path resolves to `./archive/<name>/<id>.md`, a GROUP archive (verified: docs/archive/tasks/M12.md begins `## M12` then `### T50 — done`, carries NO milestone title — only item headlines). parseMilestoneItemArchive on a group-archive file does not extract a milestone title (group.items.length !== 1 / structural mismatch) and fails-soft to title:'' — so titles stay empty and the regression test fails post-fix. The correct fix (which the task's own suggestedFix text gestures at) must source the milestone title/status from the milestones-ledger pointer (already backfilled) OR from docs/archive/milestones/<id>.md keyed by the milestone id — NOT from the per-ledger group archive at ptr.path. T110 must specify reading the milestones-archive item, not merely ungating the existing method, and must preserve InMemory parity (no on-disk archive → no backfill) and the milestones-ledger path.","T114 (D18) — acceptance/fix says 'call answerWith(item) (same handler shape as the detail view)', but no answerWith handler exists in BatchAnswerModal scope. The detail view (App.tsx:2424-2451) uses a local answerWith that sets answer-box state; the batch modal (App.tsx:1392-1481) uses an uncontrolled textarea ref (answerRef) + onSave(row, value). Picking a suggestion in the batch modal must instead populate answerRef.current.value and set answerHasText (or call onSave(row, suggestion) directly). Specify the batch-modal binding so the implementer does not chase a nonexistent handler; also iterate individual suggestion entries (Array.isArray(sv) ? sv : [sv]) rather than the single renderVal <dd> at App.tsx:1435.","T111 (D14) — completeness: the task names 'pty.e2e + the HTTP tests' but freePort() has THREE call sites (test/pty.e2e.test.ts:71, test/displayName.test.ts:56, test/mcpClient.test.ts:38). Name all three explicitly (or confirm a signature-preserving hardening of freePort() that leaves call sites untouched) so the 'all freePort call sites updated' acceptance is unambiguous.","T115 (D19) — minor: acceptance covers the 1-question close case and 'multi-question batches still advance', but D19's suggestedFix prefers recomputing the open set post-save so MID-QUEUE answers shrink the queue / close-on-empty handles a residual snapshot correctly. Add an acceptance clause for the recompute-open-set behavior (not just clamp-then-close on the last index) so a stale batchRows snapshot does not keep a fully-answered queue open."]

- summary: Plan is well-grounded on D21 (T131 sound) but T130 carries stale/inaccurate navMemo guidance, wrong test-file paths, and an acceptance that can't apply to negative-assertion tests — revise T130.
- new_questions: []
- criticism: ["T130 (navMemo T85): the prescription 'assert derivation counters not wall-clock / drop the wall-clock timeout assertion entirely' is stale. packages/ledger-tui/test/navMemo.test.tsx ALREADY asserts only the derivationCounters (lines 153-168) and ALREADY uses a waitQuiescent() poll-until-condition (lines 51-62); there is NO in-body wall-clock assertion to drop. The real residual flake is the bun DEFAULT per-test timeout (~5000ms) being exhausted by waitQuiescent (up to 200x15ms=3s) plus the 40-step nav loop (each await tick(8)) under concurrent CPU contention. Re-scope the navMemo fix to bound that wall-clock cost — e.g. tighten/cap the poll budget, lower NAV/N, or set an explicit generous it(..., timeout) — because the current acceptance ('no fixed-deadline/wall-clock assertion remains') is ALREADY satisfied for navMemo and therefore pins nothing.","T130 names flaky-test sites by FILE that do not exist: there is no packages/ledger-tui/test/scrolling.test.tsx (the 'scrolls a long list' test lives in app.test.tsx, describe 'ledger-tui scrolling', ~lines 547-567), and no suggestions.test.tsx or questionDetail.test.tsx for the 'suggestions bulleted list (T57)' / 'question detail field order (T59)' tests. Pin the actual file locations so the implementer targets the right files; the present site list misdescribes the test layout.","T130 acceptance ('all [fixed-deadline assertions] replaced by poll-until-condition over r.lastFrame()') cannot be satisfied verbatim for the NEGATIVE-assertion tests \"the 's' key is inert on an archived item\" and \"the 'e' key is inert\" (app.test.tsx ~lines 936-976): these assert the ABSENCE of an overlay after a fixed tick(40), and you cannot poll-until a frame does NOT contain something. Carve out a settle-then-assert or positive-invariant strategy for the inert-key tests and reword the acceptance so it does not mandate poll-until-condition where a negative is being checked.","T130: the navMemo derivationCounters object is module-global and shared across every test file in the bun process (the test's own comment at lines 139-142 notes this). The task's step (3) 'isolate shared module/fake-clock state between concurrently-executed files' should state concretely how — the current per-test resetDerivationCounters() guards within navMemo but cross-file pollution of that global from OTHER files' App renders is the documented hazard; specify the isolation mechanism (e.g. reset-in-beforeEach in every file that mounts App, or scope the counters) rather than leaving it as a vague directive."]
