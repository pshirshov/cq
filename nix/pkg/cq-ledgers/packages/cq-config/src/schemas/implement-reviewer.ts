 *
 * Authored DIRECTLY from `cq-assets/agents/implement-reviewer.md` — its
 * `## Catalogue` block:
 *
 * - **Input** — the task spec (id + headline + description + acceptance), the
 *   worktree path + branch + base commit, the worker's structured result
 *   (`{ resultCommit, checkSummary, filesTouched }`), the round number, and any
 *   prior criticism already addressed.
 *
 * - **Output** — the verdict block
 *   `{ taskId, verdict, criticism[], questions[], defects[], rationale,
 *   summary? }`. `verdict` is `approve | disapprove`; each `defects` item is
 *   `{ headline, description, severity, suggestedFix? }`.
