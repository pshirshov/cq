- headline: ledger-mcp fails to connect in a directory with no initialized ledger (should auto-init)
- severity: major
- description: "MCP connection fails when an agent (Claude Code / Codex) starts in a directory that has NO initialized ledger — i.e. no docs/ ledger state / no docs/ledgers.yaml present. The `@cq/ledger-mcp` server fails to connect/serve instead of degrading gracefully, so the session has no ledger tools. Desired behavior: instead of failing, automatically initialize the canonical ledger set (init the ledgers) on startup so the MCP connection succeeds in a fresh directory. Investigate the root cause — where/why the server errors on missing ledger state, what \"initialized\" means (which files/dirs are required), whether `--cwd` resolution or a missing docs/ledgers.yaml is the trigger, and where an auto-init hook should live (server startup vs store construction) — then seed fix tasks. Severity: major (blocks using the tool in any uninitialized repo; workaround = manually init the ledger files)."
- rootCause: "ledger-mcp aborts at startup with BootstrapViolationError ('existing <ledger> ledger has a different schema than its canonical bootstrap schema') thrown by FsLedgerStore.init() (packages/ledger/src/store/FsLedgerStore.ts:283-289) when an EXISTING on-disk ledger's schema diverges from its CANONICAL_LEDGERS bootstrap schema. main() (packages/ledger-mcp/src/main.ts:337-344) awaits store.init() BEFORE serving, so the throw crashes the process before the MCP handshake → client sees 'connection failed'. NOT a missing-init problem (the empty-dir auto-init path works). The divergence is a version-skew artifact (stale built/global binary vs evolved docs/ledgers.yaml, or vice-versa). Confirmed by the user's verbatim runtime error (hypothesis H4, parent H3)."
- suggestedFix: "Replace the fatal throw with a graceful BACKUP-AND-REINIT: when FsLedgerStore.init() detects a schema divergence for an existing ledger (the schemasEqual==false branch), instead of throwing BootstrapViolationError, (a) move/copy the divergent on-disk ledger file(s) (and docs/ledgers.yaml) into a timestamped backup location (e.g. docs/.backup/<ISO-timestamp>/), then (b) write fresh canonical ledger(s) + registry from CANONICAL_LEDGERS and continue startup. Surface a loud WARNING (stderr) naming the backup path so no data is silently lost. Consider a guard/opt-out flag if a non-destructive abort is ever wanted, but default to backup-and-reinit per the user. Add tests: a seeded divergent on-disk schema → init() backs up + reinitializes + serves (no throw); backup dir contains the prior files."
- dependsOn: ["T94","T95","T96","T97"]
- fix: "Backup-and-reinit on schema divergence (replaces the fatal BootstrapViolationError): T94 (0d66e33) backupAndReinit helper (timestamped docs/.backup/, ENOENT-tolerant copy of prior files, fresh canonical + stderr WARNING); T95 (a26104b) rewired FsLedgerStore.init() !schemasEqual branch to backup-and-reinit BY DEFAULT (collects the divergent set, mutates this.registry in place to canonical) + onSchemaDivergence:'abort' opt-out preserving the throw; T96 (844d240) tests (divergence→backup+reinit / abort / no-divergence / empty-dir) + migrated the 6 divergence-guard cases to the abort opt-out; T97 repo-gate green. ledger-mcp no longer crashes the MCP handshake on a stale/divergent on-disk schema — it backs up + reinitializes and serves. NOTE: a stale already-running GLOBAL binary still needs a rebuild (out of scope, captured in G4). Integration check 659 green."

- headline: "'s'-key-inert archived-item test is vacuous against an overlay-open regression (app.test.tsx) [restores D22]"
- severity: low
- description: "RESTORES D22 (re-filed open after it was erroneously set `resolved` by the user and then swept into the M35 archive by the /advance auto-archive sweep; the ledger has no un-archive/reopen-terminal path, hence the new id). Original finding (T130 reviewer, still valid): packages/ledger-tui/test/app.test.tsx (\"the 's' key is inert on an archived item\") asserts only frame.toContain('[archived]') + frame.toContain('archived task'). Per src/app.tsx, the path-header '[archived]' (cursorInArchive ~L937) and the list-pane row persist regardless of overlay state — the status overlay replaces only the right-hand content pane. So if 's' WERE wrongly handled on an archived row and opened the status picker, BOTH assertions would still pass — the test would not catch the regression. PRE-EXISTING (byte-identical to base); the sibling 'e'-inert test IS regression-sensitive (asserts 'read-only' which the overlay would replace)."
- suggestedFix: "Mirror the 'e'-inert test's content-pane sensitivity: after pressing 's', assert the status-picker is ABSENT — no SelectList '› ' cursor marker (app.tsx:1291-1296) in the frame/content pane — AND that the read-only badge '[archived · read-only]' (app.tsx:1424) is still PRESENT (a content-pane string the overlay would replace). The test file already has listSide(frame) (~L1264) for the list pane; add a complementary content-pane assertion (or assert '› ' absent from the whole frame, since the archived read-only content pane shows no SelectList). Keep the existing waitForFrame settle. Scope: packages/ledger-tui/test/app.test.tsx ONLY. bun run check."
- ledgerRefs: ["tasks:T130","goals:G2","goals:G12"]
- rootCause: "CONFIRMED (H14). The \"'s' key is inert on an archived item\" test (packages/ledger-tui/test/app.test.tsx:959-986) asserts ONLY f.toContain('[archived]') (:982) and f.toContain('archived task') (:984). Both are overlay-INSENSITIVE: '[archived]' is the path-HEADER string (app.tsx:934-939, top-level header Box) and 'archived task' is the LIST-pane row (app.tsx:1069, a separate Box); both persist regardless of overlay state. The status overlay replaces ONLY the right-hand content-pane Box (app.tsx:1071-1073: `overlay !== null ? <Overlays/> : contentEl`). So if the 's' handler's `!cursorInArchive` guard (app.tsx:803 content-focus / :838 list-focus) were removed, pressing 's' on an archived row would open the status SelectList in the content pane, yet BOTH asserted strings would still be present → the test passes, failing to catch the regression. Contrast the sibling 'e'-inert test (:988-1010) which asserts f.toContain('read-only') (:1008) — a content-pane badge ('[archived · read-only]', app.tsx:1424) the overlay WOULD replace → it IS regression-sensitive."
- dependsOn: ["T136"]
- fix: "T136 (merged b8df1c6): the \"'s' key is inert on an archived item\" test now asserts the content-pane '[archived · read-only]' badge is present (+ an optional content-pane-scoped check that the SelectList '› ' picker marker is absent), mirroring the regression-sensitive 'e'-inert test — so it FAILS if the !cursorInArchive guard regresses and 's' opens the status overlay on an archived row. Verified red-for-right-reason via scratch guard removal; app.tsx untouched; integration check green 783/0. Sole fix task T136 done."

- headline: link-prompts.ts + cq-assets/README.md still reference the relocated 'llm/' single-source tree — bun run link-prompts likely creates dangling symlinks
- severity: medium
- rootCause: "Confirmed (H21, all 8 citations re-validated against source via Bash). The LLM asset tree was relocated to `nix/pkg/cq-assets/{commands,agents}/` and `assets.nix` updated (`collectMdIn ./commands`/`./agents`, assets.nix:49-50), but `scripts/link-prompts.ts` was NOT: its 14 LINKS entries still set `source: 'llm/commands/...' / 'llm/agents/...'` (link-prompts.ts:29-44), resolved against `REPO_ROOT = dirname(script)/.. = nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/` (link-prompts.ts:19; run via package.json:13). That `llm/` root no longer exists (`ls nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/llm` -> No such file or directory). The creation loop only stats the LINK path (`linkExists`/`lstat absLink`), never the TARGET (`absSource`); `symlink(2)` succeeds on a nonexistent target, and line 73 logs success (link-prompts.ts:46-73) — so `bun run link-prompts` SILENTLY produces 14 DANGLING symlinks under `.claude/` that Claude cannot load. Separately, `nix/pkg/cq-assets/README.md` (title + convention block + Claude-link table, README.md:1,10-11,40-42) still documents the old `llm/` root."
- suggestedFix: |
    Two parts:
    1. Repoint `scripts/link-prompts.ts` LINKS `source:` paths from the vanished `llm/` root onto the real asset tree. Since assets now live at `nix/pkg/cq-assets/{commands,agents}/` (sibling of `nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/`), either (a) change each `source` to a path that resolves from REPO_ROOT to `../cq-assets/commands/...` / `../cq-assets/agents/...`, or (b) restore a `nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/llm -> ../cq-assets` symlink so the existing `llm/...` sources resolve. Prefer (a) (explicit, no hidden symlink).
    2. HARDEN the loop: assert each `absSource` exists (e.g. `test -e`/`lstat absSource`) BEFORE `symlink`, throwing loud on a missing target so a future relocation fails fast instead of silently dangling. Add a reproduce-first test (or a `--check` mode) asserting every produced link resolves (`test -e` the link target).
    3. Update `nix/pkg/cq-assets/README.md` (title, convention block, Three-consumers / Claude-link tables) to the `nix/pkg/cq-assets/...` layout.
    Acceptance: after the fix, `bun run link-prompts` produces only NON-dangling symlinks (every `.claude/**` link target satisfies `test -e`); `bun run check` green.
- description: "Filed from plan review R169 as an OUT-OF-SCOPE / pre-existing fault (file-and-defer; reviewer's explicit recommendation). It does NOT block the G15 plan — G15's own new link entries (T168/T178) were revised to verify the correct source root independently. This defect covers the PRE-EXISTING stale entries + README references. The /plan:* orchestrator re-derives the auto-investigate worklist by ledger query and may auto-launch /investigate:advance on this open defect per K12, separately from the G15 plan."

- fix: "Resolved across T179/T180/T181 (merged to main 24c1d51). T179: made link-prompts.ts import-safe (export LINKS+checkLinks, creation loop behind import.meta.main), added --check mode + reproduce-first test. T180: repointed all 14 LINKS sources llm/ -> ../cq-assets/{commands,agents}/ (all resolve) and hardened the loop to throw loud on a missing source (reuses checkLinks), flipped repro test to checkLinks(LINKS) toEqual([]). T181: de-staled cq-assets/README.md to the new layout. `bun run link-prompts` now produces 14 non-dangling symlinks; integrated bun run check green."
