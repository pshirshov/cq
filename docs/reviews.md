    summary: "Dogfood complete: T24 driven to done through the real implement-flow loop (manual worktree (K4 Codex path) -> implement-worker created+committed the marker -> bun run check green in worktree (379 pass) -> implement-reviewer approved 0/0 -> ff merge-back into throwaway dogfood/base). Throwaway branches deleted; nothing landed on main. Two setup findings recorded as defects under goals:G1."

- new_questions: []
- criticism: ["T27 mis-grounds summarize() as a shared util: it is duplicated VERBATIM in packages/ledger-tui/src/app.tsx:63 and packages/ledger-web/src/App.tsx:110 (both bodies: f[\"headline\"] ?? f[\"title\"] ?? f[\"question\"] ?? f[\"summary\"] ?? Object.values(f)[0]). T27's description assumes one shared location and its acceptance only names happy-dom WEB tests. The TUI copy ALSO falls through to the long criticism string[] for legacy reviews and needs the same truncate-first-criticism fallback. Fix: scope BOTH summarize() copies in T27 (or split a TUI-summarize subtask), and add an ink-testing-library assertion that a legacy review with no summary renders a truncated single line in the TUI, not the full joined criticism. As written, Req5 is only half-delivered for the TUI.","T34 bundles an objective automated gate (bun run check) with five manual observed-vs-expected smoke checks into one mega-task; the manual halves are not independently verifiable. Where feasible, fold each request's verification into the per-task acceptance tests it already owns (T30/T31/T32/T33/T27 each name happy-dom or ink tests) and reduce T34 to the green-check gate plus any cross-cutting regression assertion, rather than a manual five-point sweep.","T26 acceptance overstates the canonical-ledgers test: that test (packages/ledger/test/canonical-ledgers.test.ts) does NOT assert an exact reviews field-SET — it exercises specific fields plus a schema-divergence guard across docs/ledgers.yaml + examples/sample-ledger + the lib constant. Adding optional summary keeps it green but is not 'verified' by it. Either add an explicit assertion that REVIEWS_SCHEMA.fields.summary exists (type string, required:false) and that all three registry copies declare it, or reword T26's acceptance to claim only divergence-guard parity, not field-set assertion."]

- new_questions: []
- criticism: ["T37 (and the T35 decision lock) under-specify the investigation->planning handoff and conflate two incompatible mechanisms. T37 acceptance says on a confirmed root cause /investigate:advance should 'HAND OFF to plan-flow ... then the standard plan-advance<->plan-reviewer cycle produces reviewed fix tasks'. But /plan:advance (llm/commands/plan/advance.md) IS itself a command whose body runs the planner<->reviewer loop by spawning plan-advance/plan-reviewer subagents; a command cannot invoke another command's loop. So 'run the cycle' resolves to EITHER (a) /investigate:advance re-implements the plan loop inline (duplicates the loop that already lives in /plan:advance, and contradicts the Q26 file-and-defer integration principle the rest of the plan adopts), OR (b) it writes rootCause/suggestedFix, creates/extends the goal, and DEFERS to the user to run /plan:advance. The plan must pick (b) explicitly (consistent with Q26 file-and-defer + resumability) and state it in both T35's locked decision and T37's acceptance; as written the executor could build either.","T37/T35 do not specify the clarify-skip for the seeded goal. Q25 hands a defect with an ALREADY-confirmed root cause to plan-flow, but /plan:start and /plan:follow-up both re-open the goal to `clarifying` and spawn plan-advance for a FRESH clarifying round (llm/commands/plan/{start,follow-up}.md). Re-clarifying a defect whose root cause is confirmed is redundant. The handoff task must state how the seeded goal enters planning without a wasted clarifying round (e.g. seed the goal description with the confirmed root cause + suggestedFix so plan-advance has nothing left to clarify, or document that the planner may skip clarification when the goal is defect-seeded). Currently neither T35 nor T37 addresses this, leaving the executor to guess.","Cross-milestone dependency on the #1 follow-up (M6) is unstated and risks a same-file conflict. T42 edits implement-reviewer.md's returned-JSON contract to add `defects[]`, and its description asserts the contract 'currently' carries 'taskId/verdict/criticism/questions/rationale, plus the `summary` from the #1 follow-up'. But M6/T28 (the task that adds `summary` to that exact JSON contract) is still `planned`, and M8 dependsOn M7 ONLY (not M6). If M8 runs before M6/T28, T42's stated premise is false and two tasks edit the same JSON block in implement-reviewer.md independently. Either add M6 (or T28) to T42/M8's dependsOn, or reword T42 so its acceptance does not presuppose the `summary` field already exists (state the defects[] addition is independent of the summary work). Same applies to T40/T28 both editing plan-reviewer.md.","T44 acceptance is not operationally verifiable, repeating the defect R3 already flagged on the old T34. Its acceptance is 'A short written audit (in the task completion / PR description) confirming the closed loop ... with any drift corrected' plus 'no contradictory routing language remains' - a subjective prose deliverable, not a checkable command/invariant. The only mechanical clause is `bun run check` green (which a markdown-only consistency task cannot actually exercise for routing correctness). Tighten the acceptance to a verifiable form: e.g. a grep-able invariant (every fix task references `defects:` in ledgerRefs; no prompt instructs implement to execute a defect directly; the `[correct]`/`[incorrect]` evidence convention string appears identically in investigate-explorer + investigate/advance), so the audit's conclusion rests on enumerable checks rather than a narrative."]
