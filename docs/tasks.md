- headline: Rename the State Machines tab to Item States (label + ALL internal identifiers)
- description: |
    In nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/packages/ledger-web/src/App.tsx (HelpOverlay) and styles.css, rename the 'State Machines' help tab to 'Item States' per Q146 — BOTH the visible label AND every internal identifier:
    - tab-state union member 'statemachines' -> 'item-states' (the useState<...> type + every setTab/comparison);
    - visible label text 'State machines'/'State Machines' -> 'Item States';
    - data-testid help-tab-statemachines -> help-tab-item-states, help-statemachines -> help-item-states;
    - per-ledger diagram ids/section testids help-statemachine-<ledger> -> help-item-state-<ledger> (the StateMachineDiagram component + its DiagramSvg idPrefix);
    - CSS classes lw-statemachine* (e.g. lw-help-statemachines, lw-statemachine, lw-statemachine-svg) -> lw-item-state* in App.tsx AND styles.css.
    Per Q145 the TUI has no help popup and is LEFT UNCHANGED. Surgical: do not touch the Shortcuts or Flows tabs. The internal React function name (StateMachineDiagram) may stay if convenient, but every DOM-visible id/class/testid/label moves to the item-states scheme.
- acceptance: "From nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/: (negative) `rg -n 'statemachine|State machines|State Machines' packages/ledger-web/src` returns no DOM id/class/testid/label matches; (positive) `rg -n 'item-state' packages/ledger-web/src` shows the new testids/ids/classes AND the tab-state union now contains 'item-states' AND HelpOverlay renders the renamed 'Item States' tab button (data-testid help-tab-item-states) with one diagram per ledger under help-item-state-<ledger>; `bun run typecheck` green.

Hard-fails on missing ## Catalogue block; byte-deterministic (reads committed cq.toml.example via parseConfig, not live cq.toml). Narrowed the stale T275 placeholder test. Cherry-picked to main. bun run check green 1201/0; determinism re-verified (zero diff). Review APPROVE (opus + minimax)."

- description: "Add nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/packages/ledger-web/test/agentsCatalogue.gen.test.ts that (a) imports AGENT_ROLES and asserts the full Q148 role set is present with the required structured fields populated; and (b) enforces FRESHNESS: re-run the codegen (in-memory, or shell out to the gen script into a temp path) and assert the COMMITTED agentsCatalogue.gen.ts matches the freshly-generated output — so a stale generated file (cq-assets or cq.toml.example changed but not regenerated) fails CI. This automates the sync Q147 chose codegen for (replacing the Flows-tab manual cross-check)."

- description: "Per R324/opus: the structured inputs/outputs/IO-schema fields the Agents tab shows MUST have a parseable source of truth so codegen stays in sync (Q147) and the freshness test (T277) guards them. Add the `## Catalogue` structured block (the T275 convention — fenced yaml with keys inputs, outputs, ioSchema) to EVERY role's source file: nix/pkg/cq-assets/agents/*.md (plan-advance incl candidate mode, plan-reviewer, implement-worker, implement-reviewer, implement-conflict-resolver, investigate-explorer, investigate-prober, plan-synthesizer/judge) AND the orchestrator commands/cq/*.md (cq:plan/investigate/implement :advance/:start/:follow-up + cq:advance). Fill each from the role's actual prose contract. NOTE (follow-up Q151-Q153): the `## Catalogue` block holds ONLY inputs/outputs/ioSchema — the privilege class (RO/RW) and exposedTools are DERIVED from existing frontmatter by codegen (NOT authored here), so this task does NOT add privilege/tools to the blocks; it only ensures the frontmatter the derivation reads is present/correct (agents already carry disallowedTools/isolation; commands carry allowed-tools — leave those as-is). Surgical: add ONLY the `## Catalogue` block; do not alter the existing prose/behavioural body."
- acceptance: "From repo root: every Q148 role file under nix/pkg/cq-assets/agents + nix/pkg/cq-assets/commands/cq has a `## Catalogue` block parseable by parseAgentMarkdown (T275); one per file; the existing behavioural prose bodies AND the existing tool frontmatter (disallowedTools/isolation/allowed-tools) are unchanged (git diff shows only added Catalogue blocks); the T275 parser extracts each block without error."

Each block grounded in the file's actual prose contract; privilege/exposedTools remain DERIVED from frontmatter (not authored). 2 revise rounds: R2 added the 4 initially-skipped files (Q148 'all roles'); R3 flattened the ioSchema in plan-review/implement-review (nested mapping was silently dropped by the parser).

From nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/: run `bun run gen-agents` then `bun run check` (typecheck + lint + bun test) — all green; confirm no drift (`git diff --quiet -- packages/ledger-web/src/agentsCatalogue.gen.ts` after regen). From repo root: `nix build .#ledger-web` AND `nix build .#ledger-mcp` (cq-config changed) green; spot-check `.#ledger-tui` only if T272's audit actually touched a tui consumer.
