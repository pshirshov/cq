- description: "Connect the two halves and confirm they load together. Teach the dispatch extension (T224) to resolve the child session's model from the DISPATCHED AGENT'S NAME via the cq.toml maps (T223): agent NAME -> tier (via [agent_tiers]) -> concrete provider+model (via [tiers]). The per-agent tier SOURCE is the cq.toml [agent_tiers] table keyed by agent name, NOT agent markdown frontmatter (which stays byte-identical per Q126/K44). Resolution precedence: an explicit model the orchestrator passes at dispatch wins; else the agent's tier via [agent_tiers]->[tiers]; else (agent unlisted, or no [tiers]/[agent_tiers] table) fall back to the parent Pi session's active model (documented default). The extension reads cq.toml using the runtime config-access strategy PINNED in T228 (e.g. parse cq.toml at the project root via the agreed env var). Confirm the new extension + the projected agents dir (T222) + the [tiers]/[agent_tiers] tables all load together under the wrapped pi harness."

- headline: Author the harness-agnostic dispatch-trigger instruction in the Pi-side context asset
- description: |
    Close R266's COMPLETENESS gap: per decision K44 the UNCHANGED cq command prompts fire the Pi dispatch tool either because the registered tool's call shape matches the prompts' existing named-agent+task wording (T224's PRIMARY trigger) AND/OR because a harness-agnostic dispatch INSTRUCTION lives in a Pi-SIDE asset (K44's PERMITTED SUPPLEMENT). No current task AUTHORS or VERIFIES that Pi-side instruction — T224 only REGISTERS the tool, and T226/T227 merely ASSUME the unchanged prompt makes the Pi model emit a dispatch CALL rather than prose. This task authors that missing trigger.
    
    WHAT TO DO: add a harness-agnostic dispatch instruction to a PI-SIDE context asset — append to nix/pkg/llm-contexts/pi-context.md (which dev-llm.nix wires as programs.pi.appendSystemPrompt; a Pi-ONLY asset, NOT a cq command prompt, so it honors Q126/K44) telling the Pi model HOW to map the shared prompts' named-agent+task convention (an agent name + a task [+ optional isolation:"worktree"]) onto the registered dispatch tool (T224) — i.e. 'when a cq command instructs you to dispatch/launch a named subagent with a task, CALL the dispatch tool with {agent, task[, isolation]} rather than answering in prose; you cannot re-dispatch from within a child.' Reuse the exact tool name + arg shape T224 registers. Do NOT edit any file under nix/pkg/cq-assets (commands/agents/skills) and do NOT edit the Claude/Codex wiring — only the Pi-side asset (+ any programs.pi appendSystemPrompt wiring in nix/hm/dev-llm.nix needed to deliver it). This is the trigger half K44 names; it depends on T224 (the tool + its exact name/arg shape must exist to instruct against) and is a PREREQUISITE of the T226/T227 end-to-end demos (which assert an unchanged prompt actually fires the tool).
- acceptance: "Observable, end-to-end: launching piWrapped (cwd = repo root) and running an UNCHANGED cq command prompt (the same kind T226/T227 drive) results in the Pi model FIRING the dispatch tool (a tool call visible in the captured pi transcript) rather than emitting prose describing the dispatch — i.e. the Pi-side instruction demonstrably converts the prompts' named-agent+task wording into an actual dispatch tool call. `git diff` asserts nix/pkg/cq-assets is UNTOUCHED (the trigger lives only in the Pi-side asset); the only changed files are nix/pkg/llm-contexts/pi-context.md (+ any programs.pi appendSystemPrompt wiring in nix/hm/dev-llm.nix). nix build/eval of dev-llm succeeds with the appended context."

Rules: (1) harness `pi` — the model segment MUST contain a `/`; split into provider=before, model=after, both non-empty (leading/trailing slash → CqConfigError); NO `/` → BARE pi → CqConfigError (Q134 drop bare, BREAKING). (2) harness `claude` — a `/` (provider qualifier) is a CqConfigError (Q135 pi-only); provider stays null. Keep existing empty-harness/empty-model/unknown-harness errors; add precise messages for the new rejections. [aliases]/[tiers]/[agent_tiers]/reviewers/planners all flow through parseReviewerToken, inheriting the grammar."

SCOPE NOTE: this task's gate is ONLY the new parse-case tests + typecheck — NOT a full pre-existing-suite green.

Do not block T231 on those legacy fixtures."

- headline: Reject bare pi in the cq-subagent-dispatch extension's inlined mirror (tokenToChildModel)
- description: |
    Keep the extension's inlined mirror in sync with @cq/config (K46 mirror-don't-import). In `nix/pkg/pi-extensions/cq-subagent-dispatch.ts`, `tokenToChildModel` currently splits the model on `/` to emit provider+model but, when there is NO slash, FALLS BACK to `{provider:null, model}` — i.e. it accepts a bare `pi:<model>` and dispatches provider-less (exactly D36). Change it so a bare pi token is REFUSED, mirroring @cq/config's THROW-on-bare:
    
    Post-fix observable contract (state it precisely; do NOT use the misleading pre-D36 'parent fallback honored with a provider' framing):
    - harness `pi`, model contains `/`, both halves non-empty → returns `{provider:<before>, model:<after>}` (e.g. `ollama-cloud/minimax-m3` → `{provider:'ollama-cloud', model:'minimax-m3'}`). DISPATCHES provider-qualified.
    - harness `pi`, model has NO `/` (BARE) → returns `null`. The token is NOT honored as a provider-less pi dispatch; the extension's lenient design treats a null child-model as 'no override', so the child runs under the PARENT model — i.e. the bare pi token is NEVER dispatched with a provider, exactly as @cq/config now THROWS on it. (The lenient null still ultimately falls back to the parent, but the load-bearing point is: a bare `pi:<model>` is REFUSED, not silently dispatched provider-less.)
    - harness `pi`, empty half (`p/` or `/m`) → returns `null` (refused).
    - harness `claude` → unchanged: provider stays null; a `/` (provider qualifier) is not accepted for claude (mirror @cq/config's claude-rejects-qualifier). Returns the claude child model with no provider.
    
    Update the JSDoc/param comments: the `pi:<seg>` bullet and the param description that still advertises a bare `pi:grok-build` must be rewritten to the qualified-only grammar (`pi:<provider>/<model>`), and must note the @cq/config mirror obligation (parseReviewerToken THROWS on bare; this mirror returns null — both REFUSE bare). Keep the explicit-model-arg path consistent (a bare pi explicit override also returns null → parent fallback). Standalone tsc against pi 0.78.0 types stays clean.
- acceptance: "Reading the source: tokenToChildModel({harness:'pi',model:'minimax-m3'}) returns null (BARE pi REFUSED — never dispatched provider-less; the lenient null falls back to the parent model); tokenToChildModel({harness:'pi',model:'ollama-cloud/minimax-m3'}) returns {provider:'ollama-cloud',model:'minimax-m3'}; tokenToChildModel({harness:'pi',model:'p/'}) and {model:'/m'} return null; a claude token returns its model with no provider and rejects a `/` qualifier. JSDoc/param comments document the qualified-only `pi:<provider>/<model>` grammar, the bare-pi refusal, and the @cq/config mirror obligation. Standalone tsc --strict of the extension (vs pi-coding-agent 0.78.0 types) is clean."

- headline: Migrate every live pi token to the qualified form (live cq.toml + cq.toml.example) — BREAKING
- description: |
    Q134: no bare pi may remain. PATH CORRECTION: `cq.toml.example` lives at the REPO ROOT (`cq.toml.example`), NOT under `nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/`. It holds the `[aliases]` + `[tiers]` + `[agent_tiers]` blocks (verified: codex/grok=`pi:grok-build`, minimax=`pi:minimax-m3`, opus=`claude:opus-4.8[1m]`).
    
    (1) `cq.toml.example` (repo root): rewrite `[aliases]` codex/grok `"pi:grok-build"` → `"pi:grok-build/grok-build"`, minimax `"pi:minimax-m3"` → `"pi:ollama-cloud/minimax-m3"` (opus claude alias unchanged); qualify any pi value in `[tiers]`/`[agent_tiers]` (tier values that are alias NAMES stay as-is; only DIRECT pi tokens need qualifying).
    
    (2) The LIVE cq.toml driving the running ledger MCP — get_config confirms it carries the SAME bare aliases (pi/grok-build, pi/minimax-m3). Locate it via the ledger-mcp config root ($CQ_CONFIG / $CQ_PROJECT_ROOT/cq.toml / the path .#ledger-mcp launches with; cq.toml is gitignored) and apply the IDENTICAL migration to its [aliases] + any [tiers]/[agent_tiers].
    
    ACTIVATION-ORDERING HAZARD (must honor): T231 makes @cq/config loadConfig THROW on any bare `pi:<model>`, and the RUNNING ledger MCP re-reads the live cq.toml on EVERY get_config/get_reviewers/get_planners call. If T231's grammar activates (a rebuild + MCP restart) while the live cq.toml still holds bare pi tokens, every config read throws and the orchestrator breaks mid-flow. THEREFORE: the live-cq.toml migration (step 2) MUST land together with / before T231's activation — i.e. migrate the live config BEFORE any rebuild/restart that ships the breaking grammar. Treat step 2 as co-merged-with-T231, not a later step.
    
    PROVIDER MAPPING (D36/Q132, verified against nix/hm/dev-llm.nix): minimax-m3 → `ollama-cloud` (pi-ollama-cloud, OAuth $OLLAMA_API_KEY) — NOT the key-gated `minimax` provider (@sinamtz/pi-minimax-provider, $MINIMAX_API_KEY, which is what bare pi:minimax-m3 fuzzy-resolved to and caused the abstentions); grok-build → `grok-build` provider (pi-xai). SANITY CHECK each migrated `<model>` exists under its target provider's registered model list (guard typos like 'minmax' / wrong provider) — cross-check against the dev-llm.nix provider registrations.
    
    After migration the config still loads (no dangling alias, no bare-pi error).
- acceptance: "REPRODUCIBLE (clean-checkout / CI) gate: a test loads `cq.toml.example` (repo root) and asserts its minimax alias resolves to {harness:'pi',model:'minimax-m3',provider:'ollama-cloud'} and codex/grok to {harness:'pi',model:'grok-build',provider:'grok-build'}; and a grep of `cq.toml.example` finds no bare `pi:<word>` (slash-free) token. LIVE-CONFIG local step (gitignored, NOT a CI assertion): after editing the live cq.toml, get_config re-read THIS session shows every pi alias/tier with a non-null provider (minimax→ollama-cloud, codex/grok→grok-build), configured:true, no load error — this is the documented local step the T239 gate spot-checks. Each migrated <model> verified present under its target provider per dev-llm.nix (no typo)."

- description: |
    The breaking grammar invalidates EXISTING fixtures across the workspace that use bare pi tokens and assertions expecting the old `{harness,model}` (no provider) shape. Migrate ALL of them — not only the @cq/config file:
    
    (1) `packages/cq-config/test/config.test.ts`: rewrite VALID_TOML / *_WITH_PLANNERS / *_WITH_TIERS / *_WITH_WEBUI so every pi alias/tier value is provider-qualified (`pi:<provider>/<model>`); update every ReviewerToken `toEqual` to include the new `provider` field (string for pi, null for claude); the existing 'preserves colons inside the model segment' (`pi:provider:model`) test must be re-examined — with slash extraction a slash-free model is now a BARE-pi error, so replace it with a slash-based case.
    
    (2) `@cq/ledger-mcp` config-capability tests: T232 adds `provider` to the STRUCTURAL ResolvedReviewer/ResolvedPlanner + GetConfigResult (aliases + tier slots) and the ledger-mcp projection. VERIFY whether any ledger-mcp test (e.g. packages/ledger-mcp/test/*config*; the computeReviewers/computePlanners/projectConfig/get_config|get_reviewers|get_planners coverage) DEEP-ASSERTS the old `{harness,model}` reviewer/config shape or uses bare-pi fixtures — if so, FOLD them into this task: add the `provider` field to those deep assertions and qualify their pi fixtures. Search the test tree (rg for `harness:` toEqual blocks, bare `pi:<word>` literals, and config-capability assertions) so NONE survive.
    
    (3) Any OTHER bare-pi fixture anywhere in nix/pkg/cq-ledgers (and the extension's own tests if present) — migrate it here too, so the T239 repo-wide `rg` audit has ZERO unplanned survivor.
    
    This task ADAPTS pre-existing tests broken by the grammar change; the NEW positive/negative grammar parse-cases live in T231's acceptance and the cross-layer consistency cases live in T238.
- acceptance: "`bun test` in nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/ — the FULL pre-existing suite (config.test.ts AND every ledger-mcp config-capability test) passes against the new grammar; no bare pi fixture remains anywhere (a grep of the test tree finds no `\"pi:<word>\"` value lacking a `/`, except inside `expect(...).toThrow`/bare-pi-rejection cases); every reviewer/config deep-assertion that previously asserted `{harness,model}` now also asserts the `provider` field.

    Q136 acceptance evidence. Add tests in `packages/cq-config/test/config.test.ts` (+ a ledger-mcp config test if capability tests live there): (1) a cq.toml with `[aliases] minimax="pi:ollama-cloud/minimax-m3"`, reviewers/planners referencing it, and a `[tiers]`/`[agent_tiers]` block, resolved END-TO-END — resolveReviewers/resolvePlanners + resolveAgentModel return tokens carrying provider:'ollama-cloud', model:'minimax-m3'; (2) bare pi anywhere (alias/tier value, or reviewers/planners alias resolving to bare) throws CqConfigError at parse/load.
    
    (3) CROSS-LAYER consistency test (Q136 option c) — specify the invariant CONCRETELY: for a SHARED token-fixture table, `parseReviewerToken(s)` ACCEPTS iff the extension's `tokenToChildModel(s)` accepts, and when both accept they AGREE on (harness, model, provider). The extension (`nix/pkg/pi-extensions/cq-subagent-dispatch.ts`) cannot be imported (standalone store-path file, K46), so IMPLEMENT this by COPYING the extension's `tokenToChildModel` parse logic into the test as a local replica (the test's own copy of the mirror), then for each fixture row assert the two parses agree:
      - 'pi:ollama-cloud/minimax-m3' → parseReviewerToken returns {harness:'pi',model:'minimax-m3',provider:'ollama-cloud'} AND the replica returns {provider:'ollama-cloud',model:'minimax-m3'} (agree on model+provider; harness pi).
      - 'pi:grok-build/grok-build' → both accept, agree.
      - 'pi:minimax-m3' (BARE) → parseReviewerToken THROWS AND the replica returns null — BOTH REFUSE.
      - 'pi:p/' and 'pi:/m' (empty half) → parseReviewerToken THROWS AND replica returns null — both refuse.
      - 'claude:opus-4.8[1m]' → parseReviewerToken returns provider:null; replica returns the claude model with no provider; 'claude:x/y' → parseReviewerToken THROWS (claude rejects qualifier).
    The table is the regression guard cited by T236: it FAILS if either layer's grammar drifts. Reuse T225's recorded live `--provider ollama-cloud` evidence for the dispatch-half empirical claim; NO new live demo required (Q136 option a).

    Closing gate (folded from the minimax candidate). From `nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/` run `bun run check` (typecheck + lint + test) GREEN. Standalone-typecheck the extension (`nix/pkg/pi-extensions/cq-subagent-dispatch.ts`) vs pi 0.78.0 types. From the repo root run `nix build .#ledger-mcp .#ledger-tui .#ledger-web` to confirm no FOD/build breakage (no new deps expected).
    
    LIVE-CONFIG SPOT-CHECK (activation-ordering, per T234): assert the LIVE cq.toml the running ledger MCP reads STILL LOADS after the breaking grammar — call get_config and confirm configured:true with every pi alias/tier carrying a non-null provider (minimax→ollama-cloud, codex/grok→grok-build) and NO load error. A throw here means the live config was not migrated before activation (the T231→T234 hazard) — report it as a blocker.
    
    REPO-WIDE bare-pi AUDIT — PATH CORRECTED: `cq.toml.example` is at the REPO ROOT. Run `rg -n 'pi:[A-Za-z0-9._-]+' nix/pkg/cq-ledgers cq.toml.example` (+ the live cq.toml path) and confirm every matched pi token has a `/` after the harness colon (i.e. is `pi:<provider>/<model>`), OR is a documented migration-callout string in docs.

The gate FAILS LOUDLY with a remediation pointer — naming the offending file:line and instructing 'qualify to pi:<provider>/<model> per T234' — if any un-migrated bare-pi token (or a live-config load error) is found."
