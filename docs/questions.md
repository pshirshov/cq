- question: "D2 does NOT reproduce from source — the requested auto-init already exists and works. To find the real root cause, what did you actually observe? Please provide: (a) the exact client error / how 'MCP connection fails' surfaced; (b) HOW the ledger MCP server was launched in that directory — from source (`bun … main.ts`), the Nix-built product (`nix build .#ledger-mcp`), or the globally plugin-registered (home-manager) binary [version skew is the prime suspect — see H3 / cf. D1]; (c) whether that directory even had a `.mcp.json` / plugin wiring the ledger server (no wiring = 'not configured', not a connection failure); (d) was it THIS repo or a different/empty project, and was the dir writable?"
- context: "Round 1 of investigation. H1 (server-startup registry-load throws) and H2 (FsLedgerStore construction/index-build throws) both adjudicated WRONG by orchestrator-verified citations + a live reproduction: FsLedgerStore.init() (packages/ledger/src/store/FsLedgerStore.ts:254-340), called by main() (packages/ledger-mcp/src/main.ts:337-344) BEFORE serving, mkdir's docs/ recursively, swallows ENOENT on the registry and each ledger file, writes EMPTY_REGISTRY, and bootstraps CANONICAL_LEDGERS. Reproduction: `bun packages/ledger-mcp/src/main.ts --cwd <fresh empty tmpdir>` printed 'serving stdio MCP', exited 0, and auto-created docs/ledgers.yaml + all canonical ledger files. So the source already does exactly what D2 requests. Remaining live hypothesis H3 (environmental: stale globally-registered/Nix binary version-skew like D1, or --cwd/.mcp.json wiring) needs your environment data to adjudicate. After answering, re-run /investigate:advance D2."
- suggestions: ["Most likely: the globally plugin-registered (home-manager/Nix) ledger-mcp binary is older than the source that has the auto-init — rebuild/refresh it (version skew, cf. D1) and retest","The directory had no .mcp.json wiring the ledger server (so it was never configured, not a 'connection failure')","A --cwd resolved to a non-existent or unwritable path","Something else — paste the actual error"]
- recommendation: Capture the exact failure + launch method; if it's the globally-registered binary, rebuild it and retest before we plan any code fix (source already auto-inits, so a code change may be unnecessary).
- ledgerRefs: ["defects:D2","hypothesis:H3"]
- answer: "User-provided actual error: `ledger-mcp: fatal: Bootstrap invariant violated: existing goals ledger has a different schema than its canonical bootstrap schema`. So the failure is NOT missing-init (the empty-dir auto-init works) — it is the BootstrapViolationError thrown by FsLedgerStore.init() (packages/ledger/src/store/FsLedgerStore.ts:283-289) when an EXISTING on-disk ledger's schema diverges from its CANONICAL_LEDGERS bootstrap schema (e.g. a stale/version-skewed binary vs an evolved docs/ledgers.yaml). Confirms the H3 environmental direction. Desired fix (user): on such a divergence, automatically BACK UP the old/divergent ledger files and set up fresh canonical ledgers, instead of aborting with a fatal error."
