LOAD-BEARING (opus, precedent-cited): T307 acceptance falsely presumes `nix build .#llm-skills` validates the 4 edited cq-assets governance prompts — FALSE: cq-assets is consumed EVAL-TIME-ONLY (assets.nix builtins.readFile/readDir); .#llm-skills builds nix/pkg/llm-skills and never reads cq-assets/agents|commands; no buildable derivation vendors the prompt files, so the nix build exits 0 regardless of T301-T304's edits (ZERO regression coverage). Identical to G31 (R280 revise → R281 go-ahead). Fix: drop the nix-build-validates claim; make `bun run check` + the T306 grep-invariant the SUBSTANTIVE gate; fix the goal's acceptance note. REAL (minimax): T304's 'same marker' wording contradicts T306's 4-distinct-cells assertion — reconcile to 4 distinct (file,marker) cells. Plus minimax hardening: make T306 file-scoped explicit; tighten T301's general cross-checkout-git prohibition; add T305 reproduction-first narration; keep the home-manager-switch live-activation note explicit (already present, not a new autonomous task — user/environment deploy action like D37/D41). Otherwise both confirm: T301 closes part-a; T302/T303/T304 close part-b non-regressively; DAG acyclic; T306 grep-invariant is the right guard for eval-time-only prompts."

ADJUDICATION: minimax nit#1 — cell-4's comment 'absent from implement/advance.md, confirming file-specificity' describes a TRUE-but-unasserted property (the marker IS verified absent from implement/advance.md: grep 0× by both opus and orchestrator); it is a comment documenting marker SELECTION rationale, not a claimed test assertion — factually correct, non-blocking (a comment-wording fix would need a disproportionate worker+merge round). minimax nit#2 (long-exact-marker brittleness) is BY DESIGN for grep-invariants (matches T255/T264).

NOTE: minimax not separately run for this backfill — T304 is the chained-twin of T303 (minimax approved R367) and its content is transitively verified by the T306 cell-4 grep-invariant (asserts THIS marker in advance.md) + T307 green. No defect found; the merge stands."

- summary: "REVISE (G38 round 1; full panel opus[claude]+codex+grok+minimax[pi], 4/4 usable, all revise → reconciled revise). Plan is fine-grained/acyclic/grounded/complete, but the agentsCatalogue.gen.ts regen for the advance.md edits is mis-sequenced (LOAD-BEARING, opus-verified against gen-agents-catalogue.ts L106/L142), the standalone test tasks are vague/duplicative, and several groundings/acceptances need correction. 0 new_questions, 0 out-of-scope defects."
- new_questions: []
- criticism: ["[opus] LOAD-BEARING: T308's parenthetical ('gen-agents covers agents/, not commands/ — no regen needed for a command file') is FALSE — VERIFIED against gen-agents-catalogue.ts: ROLES (L106) catalogues commands/cq/implement/advance.md (id 'implement/advance') and buildRole (L142) captures its full body as promptTemplate. Adding the markers to advance.md's BODY therefore DOES change agentsCatalogue.gen.ts and requires `bun run gen-agents`. Correct the justification.","[opus] Mis-sequencing + scope gap: T310 was the only task running gen-agents but had no dependsOn on T308/T309 and scoped the regen only around implement-worker.md; the advance.md body edits would silently desync agentsCatalogue.gen.ts, uncaught by T311/T321 which grep only the .md sources. FIX: make the gen-agents regen its OWN task depending on T308+T309+T310, and add a committed assertion that the regenerated gen.ts 'implement/advance' promptTemplate contains both advance.md markers.","[codex][grok] T309's dependsOn T308 has no logical prerequisite — the §1 sweep and §7.3 teardown edit disjoint sections of advance.md. Reconcile: re-justify the edge explicitly as SAME-FILE serialization (avoid a concurrent-worktree merge conflict on advance.md).","[codex][grok] T310 read as unjustified scope vs Q167 + used inconsistent 'post-merge teardown' vs the locked 'after the per-task done write' terminology. Resolve against the [opus] finding (regen IS required): keep worker.md alignment as item-1a prompt scope, align terminology, move the regen to its own sequenced task.","[codex][grok] Standalone test tasks T314/T317/T320 are vague 'consolidated/dedupe' meta-tasks while the impl acceptances already enumerate the same tests — and a separate test task is incoherent for this flow (each impl worktree must pass `bun run check` WITH its own tests). FIX: fold the test cells into the owning impl tasks and DROP T314/T317/T320.","[codex] D44 severity 'minor' vs Q172 'low/medium' — align it (defect already filed; no separate filing task needed).","[codex] T318/T319 'shared helper' for raw Home/End ESC sequences is unscoped — name the module/function (a module-level helper in ledger-tui/src/app.tsx, reused by both focus branches).","[grok] T312 mandates a new FsLedgerStoreOpts flag not implied by Q168/Q169; the only test-affordance needed is honoring XDG_CACHE_HOME. Drop/soften the flag.","[grok] T308 acceptance hinges on the literal 'Claude: auto' — VERIFIED present (implement/advance.md L310-311), so grounded; keep but phrase robustly.","[opus][codex][minimax] T313 adding `restore` CONTRADICTS the main.ts header (L23-24: lifecycle ops live in the `cq` CLI; 'this server only serves the tool surface') — VERIFIED main.ts only parses --cwd/--http. T313 must ALSO update that header comment.","[grok][minimax] T317's '(dedupe with T315)' mislabels its sibling (should be T316) — mooted by dropping T317.","[minimax] T310's acceptance mixes byte-faithful + contains-marker invariants — split (handled by moving the regen to its own task with split acceptance)."]

All 12 R372 criticisms verified resolved by all four reviewers (T308 justification, T322 regen task + gen.ts freshness guard, T309 serialization rationale, T310 scope/terminology, folded test tasks, D44=low, matchHomeEnd helper, T312 XDG affordance, T313 main.ts header update). codex raised 3 NEW minor plan-text PRECISION nits (no load-bearing/sequencing/testability/completeness defect; grok+minimax explicitly judged them non-blocking). Addressing them anyway for precision; convergent.
- new_questions: []
- criticism: ["[codex] Unify the prompt source-file references across M127: use the FULL path consistently — T308/T309 edit nix/pkg/cq-assets/commands/cq/implement/advance.md (catalogue key 'implement/advance'); T310 edits nix/pkg/cq-assets/agents/implement-worker.md (catalogue key 'implement-worker'). T311/T322 acceptance use the shorthand 'advance.md'/'implement-worker.md' — make them name the full path + catalogue key so there is no ambiguity about which artifact each marker/promptTemplate assertion targets.","[codex] T322 omits the invocation cwd for `bun run gen-agents`: the 1a edits live under nix/pkg/cq-assets/ but the gen-agents script is a package script of the cq-ledgers workspace — state explicitly that it runs from nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/ (per CLAUDE.md the bun commands run from there), to avoid an exec error.","[codex] T312's cacheMirrorDir formula writes a bare 'basename'/'sha256(absRoot)' — qualify it: path.basename(absRoot) and crypto.createHash('sha256').update(absRoot).digest('hex').slice(0,12), and have the acceptance pin the FULL computed dir name (basename + '-' + 12hex), not only the suffix regex."]

Validated against SOURCE (the actual ledger task items), every grok point is already satisfied: T308/T309 descriptions open 'In nix/pkg/cq-assets/commands/cq/implement/advance.md …' (full path); T310 'Update nix/pkg/cq-assets/agents/implement-worker.md …'; T322/T311 name packages/ledger-web/src/agentsCatalogue.gen.ts + the catalogue keys 'implement/advance'/'implement-worker'; T312 spells out cacheMirrorDir(absRootDir)=path.join(cacheBase,'cq','ledgers',`${path.basename(absRootDir)}-${createHash('sha256').update(absRootDir).digest('hex').slice(0,12)}`) with the full-dir-name acceptance. Because the criticism is FALSE against ground truth, the surviving real-criticism set is empty → reconciled go-ahead (citation-validation per the orchestrator's duty, NOT a laundered revise).
