/**
 * investigate-explorer role schema sidecar (T341, goal G41) — generalising the

 * decision 3: per-role typed sidecar under `./schemas/`).
 *
 * Authored DIRECTLY from `cq-assets/agents/investigate-explorer.md` — its
 * `## Catalogue` block:
 *
 * - **Input** — the hypothesis id `H` and its statement (verbatim), the branch
 *   context (defect, parent hypothesis, sibling findings, confirm/rule-out
 *   intent), and optional specific leads.
 *
 * - **Output** — the evidence block
 *   `{ hypothesisId, evidence[], lean, notes?, probeRequest? }`. Each evidence
 *   item is `{ n, citation, excerpt, relevance }`; `lean` is one of
 *   `supports | contradicts | mixed | insufficient`; `probeRequest` (omitted by
 *   default) is `{ what, why }` and is only present when execution is needed to
 *   settle H — in which case `lean` MUST be `insufficient`.
