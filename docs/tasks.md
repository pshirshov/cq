- headline: "Acceptance demo: one read-only explorer dispatch under Pi returning parseable evidence-json"
- description: "Per Q128 (acceptance, 'as recommended') AND R265's END-TO-END Q126 verification gap: demonstrate ONE read-only explorer dispatch (investigate-style) completing UNDER PI on THIS repo in the NORMAL non-sandboxed env, DRIVEN BY THE ACTUAL UNCHANGED cq command prompt — NOT by a hand-written dispatch_agent({...}) call. Launch the wrapped pi harness (piWrapped, cwd = repo root) and run an UNCHANGED cq command that fires an investigate-explorer dispatch (e.g. the investigate/advance promptTemplate against a real hypothesis + branch context about this repo). Per decision K44 the prompt text itself stays byte-identical (any Pi-side trigger lives in a Pi-side context asset, never in nix/pkg/cq-assets). Observe the Pi model fire the dispatch tool from that unchanged prompt, the child run read-only (filtered toolset: no Write/Bash/dispatch per investigate-explorer's disallowedTools), and the child return the explorer's structured evidence block (numbered file:line + excerpt + relevance) that the orchestrator can parse. Capture the prompt invocation, the dispatch the model emitted, the child's filtered toolset, and the returned structured result as evidence."

    - tab-state union member 'statemachines' -> 'item-states' (the useState<...> type + every setTab/comparison);

    - CSS classes lw-statemachine* (e.g. lw-help-statemachines, lw-statemachine, lw-statemachine-svg) -> lw-item-state* in App.tsx AND styles.css.
    Per Q145 the TUI has no help popup and is LEFT UNCHANGED. Surgical: do not touch the Shortcuts or Flows tabs. The internal React function name (StateMachineDiagram) may stay if convenient, but every DOM-visible id/class/testid/label moves to the item-states scheme.
