    summary: TUI + web UI improvements — complete. Per-ledger counts (T1), answer-and-resolve for questions (T2), view persistence (T3), embedded in-process MCP mode for ledger-tui + ledger-web (T17–T22), question-detail field order + highlighted recommendation (T23). Decision K2 (in-process = co-locate the MCP server, don't bypass MCP). Defect D1 (web counts undefined) resolved. Shipped on main (commits 63df0f3, 5cf4916; merged b510170).

- headline: ledger-mcp fails to connect in a directory with no initialized ledger (should auto-init)
- severity: major
- description: "MCP connection fails when an agent (Claude Code / Codex) starts in a directory that has NO initialized ledger — i.e. no docs/ ledger state / no docs/ledgers.yaml present. The `@cq/ledger-mcp` server fails to connect/serve instead of degrading gracefully, so the session has no ledger tools. Desired behavior: instead of failing, automatically initialize the canonical ledger set (init the ledgers) on startup so the MCP connection succeeds in a fresh directory. Investigate the root cause — where/why the server errors on missing ledger state, what \"initialized\" means (which files/dirs are required), whether `--cwd` resolution or a missing docs/ledgers.yaml is the trigger, and where an auto-init hook should live (server startup vs store construction) — then seed fix tasks. Severity: major (blocks using the tool in any uninitialized repo; workaround = manually init the ledger files)."
