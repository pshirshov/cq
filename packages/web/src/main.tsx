 * never re-created on re-renders (G2c: F-18 — no module-global Manager inside
 * components). <App> and all descendants access it via useConnection() /
 * useConnectionStats().
 *
 * No teardown is registered: main.tsx mounts the root once for the lifetime of
 * the browser tab. The Manager's destroy() would be called by <App>'s unmount
 * in a test environment, but in production the tab lifecycle owns cleanup.
