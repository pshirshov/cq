# Codex prompts — plan-flow

These four prompts are **symlinks into the repo-root `prompts/` directory**, the
single source of truth shared with Claude Code (`.claude/commands/plan/*`,
`.claude/agents/*`). Edit the files under `prompts/`; never edit the symlinks.

| Codex prompt file              | Source (`prompts/`)        | Claude location                      | Role |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|------|
| `plan-start.md`                | `plan-start.md`            | `.claude/commands/plan/start.md`     | slash command — start a goal, file first questions |
| `plan-advance.md`              | `plan-advance.md`          | `.claude/commands/plan/advance.md`   | slash command — thin planner↔reviewer loop |
| `plan-advance-agent.md`        | `plan-advance-agent.md`    | `.claude/agents/plan-advance.md`     | subagent — the planner (one state step) |
| `plan-reviewer.md`             | `plan-reviewer.md`         | `.claude/agents/plan-reviewer.md`    | subagent — the adversarial reviewer |

## How Codex consumes these

- Codex exposes files in a `prompts/` directory as slash commands. The two
  command prompts (`plan-start`, `plan-advance`) are usable directly.
- The two agent prompts carry Claude-style `name:` / `description:` / `tools:`
  YAML frontmatter. Codex may ignore unknown frontmatter keys — that is
  acceptable; the canonical content is the prompt BODY, which is tool-agnostic.
  Under Codex's multi-agent mode, route the planner/reviewer bodies to
  sub-agents accordingly. The body's "Output contract" / status-token discipline
  is what the loop depends on, not the frontmatter.

## Runtime identity (read before running)

Every ledger write in these prompts must carry provenance:

- `author` = the class of the model **actually executing the prompt**, derived
  from runtime identity — never a hardcoded literal. A Codex GPT-5.x run writes
  its own class (e.g. `"gpt-5.5"`); a Claude Opus 4.8 (1M) run writes
  `"opus-4.8[1m]"`.
- `session` = the running session id (`$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` under Claude, or
  the Codex session-id equivalent).

## Ledger reference (must match the `@cq/ledger` schema exactly)

- `goals` phases: `clarifying → planning → planned → building → done / abandoned`
  (server-enforced transition guard; `planning ↔ clarifying` allowed).
- A goal cannot LEAVE `clarifying` while any linked `questions` item is `open`;
  cannot ENTER `planned` without a `locked` `decisions` item linking it.
- `questions` statuses: `open → answered / withdrawn`. Fields: `question`
  (required), `context`, `suggestions` (string[]), `recommendation`, `answer`.
- `decisions` statuses: `proposed → locked / superseded`. Field `headline`
  required.
- `reviews` statuses (the verdict): `go-ahead` | `revise` (both terminal).
  Fields: `new_questions` (string[]), `criticism` (string[]), `ledgerRefs`.
- Cross-ledger link: `fields.ledgerRefs: ["goals:<G>"]`.
- MCP tools (server name `ledger`): `create_milestone`, `create_item(ledger_id,
  milestone_id, status, fields, author?, session?)`, `update_item(ledger_id,
  item_id, status?, fields?, author?, session?)`, `fetch_item`, `fetch_ledger`,
  `fts_search`, `list_milestone_items`, `enumerate_ledgers`.
