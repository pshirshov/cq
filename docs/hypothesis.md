- headline: "D43 root cause = a two-part prompt gap: (a) the implement-worker agent prompt does not confine the worker to its own worktree (no ban on git ops against the main checkout) while native isolation:worktree's stale-base drives cross-checkout git surgery; (b) the *:advance commit discipline defers ledger commits (only after archive_milestone + at run-stop), so a long run accrues uncommitted ledger a stray reset erases"
- description: "What would make this true: (a) nix/pkg/cq-assets/agents/implement-worker.md contains NO instruction forbidding the worker from running git against the main checkout / other worktrees and no 'reset only within your own worktree' rule; the native worktree forks from a stale base (observed 087b889 vs current main). (b) nix/pkg/cq-assets/commands/cq/advance.md + commands/cq/implement/advance.md commit the ledger ONLY after archive_milestone + at the run/standalone stop (no commit-after-every-merge), and commands/cq/plan/advance.md has no commit-after-planning-lock; chained sub-flows suppress at-stop commits. Confirm by reading the current prompt files. Evidence basis: this session's reflog (HEAD@{3} reset in the MAIN checkout discarded uncommitted docs/*.md) is already captured in D43.description."
