- description: "Add an OPTIONAL single-line `summary: { type: 'string', required: false }` to REVIEWS_SCHEMA in packages/ledger/src/constants.ts. Mirror the change in the live registry docs/ledgers.yaml and the examples/sample-ledger/docs/ledgers.yaml copy. Update packages/ledger/test/canonical-ledgers.test.ts (and any other test asserting the reviews field set) so the canonical-set assertion includes `summary`. Keep it optional so existing reviews (R1, and any prior) remain valid — no migration/backfill. This is the foundational schema change other Req5 tasks build on. Per Q16 'as recommended': optional single-line summary, all three registry copies + canonical test updated."
- acceptance: "REVIEWS_SCHEMA.fields.summary exists with type 'string' and required:false (assert this EXPLICITLY in a test — do NOT rely on the canonical-ledgers test, which only exercises specific fields plus a schema-divergence guard and does NOT assert an exact reviews field-SET). Add/extend an assertion that all THREE registry copies declare `summary`: the lib constant REVIEWS_SCHEMA, docs/ledgers.yaml, and examples/sample-ledger/docs/ledgers.yaml. The existing canonical-ledgers.test.ts must still pass on divergence-guard parity (its role here is only to confirm the three copies stay in sync, NOT to verify the field's presence/type). Existing reviews items with no summary still load/validate. `bun test packages/ledger` green; `bun run typecheck` green."

- description: "summarize() is NOT a shared util — it is duplicated VERBATIM in TWO files: packages/ledger-tui/src/app.tsx:63 and packages/ledger-web/src/App.tsx:110, both bodies `f[\"headline\"] ?? f[\"title\"] ?? f[\"question\"] ?? f[\"summary\"] ?? Object.values(f)[0]`. With the schema field added (T26), reviews now carry a short summary, but LEGACY reviews (R1, R3) have none and BOTH copies fall through to the long criticism string[]. Scope BOTH copies in this task: (a-web) packages/ledger-web/src/App.tsx summarize() — already prefers `summary`; add a graceful fallback for legacy reviews with no summary (truncate the FIRST criticism line rather than dumping the whole joined string[]). (a-tui) packages/ledger-tui/src/app.tsx summarize() — apply the IDENTICAL truncate-first-criticism fallback so the TUI does not render the full joined criticism for legacy reviews. (b) Web ItemTable CSS/markup: set white-space:nowrap on the `.lw-status` badge AND clamp the summary <td> to a single line with ellipsis for ALL ledgers (uniform row height) — per Q17 'as recommended'. Locate the web ItemTable component + its stylesheet. NOTE: if the two summarize() bodies are easy to converge, optionally extract a shared helper, but the contract here is that BOTH frontends get the legacy-review fallback — do not deliver Req5 for the web only."
- acceptance: "BOTH frontends: reviews rows show the short `summary`, not the long criticism. WEB: a legacy review with no summary renders a truncated single-line fallback (not the full joined criticism); the `go-ahead`/`revise` badge no longer wraps; summary cell is single-line ellipsis across all ledgers — assert via happy-dom web tests. TUI: an ink-testing-library test asserts that a legacy review with no summary renders a truncated SINGLE line (not the full joined criticism string[]). `bun run check` green."

(b) llm/agents/implement-reviewer.md — add a `summary` field to the JSON contract the reviewer returns (taskId/verdict/criticism/questions/rationale + summary). (c) llm/commands/implement/advance.md — map the reviewer JSON `summary` into the create_item('reviews', ...) fields when recording the terminal review, synthesizing a one-line fallback from rationale/verdict if the model omits it. Note these implement-* prompts are authored under M3 (depends-on); coordinate so summary is baked in rather than retrofitted. Edits are prompt/markdown only — no code paths."
- acceptance: plan-reviewer.md create_item example includes summary; implement-reviewer.md JSON contract documents a `summary` string; implement/advance.md explicitly maps summary into the recorded reviews item with a documented fallback. No schema/type regressions; `bun run check` unaffected (markdown-only) but run it to confirm.

The web mcpClient does NOT yet implement fetchLedgerArchive — add it so the web frontend can read a chosen milestone's archived items over MCP (frontends never read docs/ directly). Confirm the TUI client has (or add) the same archive-read method for parity so T31 can consume it. This task is plumbing only: client method + types; no UI rendering yet. archivePointers already arrive on fetch_ledger."
- acceptance: web mcpClient exposes fetchLedgerArchive(ledgerId, archiveId) returning the typed archived group/item; TUI client has the equivalent; a unit/integration test exercises a fetch against a seeded archive (read-only). `bun run check` green.
- suggestedModel: standard

Drop the now-redundant per-row milestone column (the subsection header carries it). Exclude the milestones ledger itself (no meaningful sub-grouping). fetch_ledger already returns items grouped with resolved milestone title/status, so no extra calls. Touches the web ItemTable component, its toolbar (add the milestone <select> beside the status <select>), and styles."
- acceptance: Web ItemTable shows collapsible per-milestone subsections in fetch_ledger group order with id+title+status headers; a milestone dropdown narrows to one milestone and ANDs with status; per-row milestone column removed; milestones ledger view unaffected. happy-dom tests for the new controls pass (selects are controlled — fine under happy-dom); `bun run check` green.

Columns are id | status | summary — NO milestone column (the Req3 subsection header carries milestone). Add per-milestone SUBSECTIONS to the TUI list too (header = resolved milestone id+title+status, fetch_ledger group order), excluding the milestones ledger. Must degrade in a narrow, resizable left pane (ratio 0.2-0.8, dockable right/bottom): id/status fixed-padded, summary absorbs remaining width and truncates. Preserve the cursor prefix and optional 1-char scrollbar column in ScrollList."
- acceptance: TUI rows align in columns regardless of id width ('T1' vs 'T14'); status column aligned; summary truncates to fit a narrow pane; per-milestone subsection headers render in group order; milestones ledger view unaffected; cursor + scrollbar still work. ink-testing-library tests assert column alignment + subsection headers; `bun run check` green.

Archived items are detached/terminal: suppress ALL edit affordances (status edit, field save, quick-transition buttons, answer) for them in the web detail panel. No new MCP tool (the user permitted adding one only if it benefits agents — not needed for this read-only UI). Touches the web toolbar/ledger view + detail panel (gate its edit controls on an isArchived flag)."
- acceptance: Web shows a per-ledger 'show archived' control; selecting a pointer lists that milestone's archived items; opening one shows fields read-only with NO edit/transition/answer controls; active-item editing unchanged. happy-dom tests cover the toggle + read-only suppression; `bun run check` green.

Add a per-ledger 'show archived' toggle/section that lists archivePointers and, on selection, lazily fetches that milestone's archived items (TUI client method from T29) and renders them READ-ONLY — suppress every edit/transition/answer keybinding for archived items. Reach archives via a toggle within the existing ledger view (mirror the web affordance) rather than a separate top-level pseudo-ledger. Integrate with the new column table/subsections (T31) so archived items use the same row layout."
- acceptance: TUI exposes a 'show archived' affordance per ledger; selecting a pointer lists archived items read-only; edit/transition/answer keys are inert on archived items; layout matches the T31 column table. ink-testing-library tests cover the archive toggle + read-only suppression; `bun run check` green.

This task is reduced to: (1) run `bun run check` (tsc + eslint + bun test) at repo root — must be fully green, confirming all the per-task suites pass together; (2) add/confirm a cross-cutting regression assertion that the changes do not break active-item editing or the plan/implement flows (the one verification that no single per-task test owns because it spans the UI changes collectively) — e.g. an existing-behavior smoke test that active items still render with edit/transition affordances after the archive/subsection/column work. Any defect surfaced by the green-check run is filed as a `defects` item linked to G1 before this task is marked done. The five per-request behaviors are NOT re-verified manually here — they are owned by T27/T30/T31/T32/T33 acceptance tests."

- headline: "Lock the investigate:* design decision (hypothesis-ledger tree, loop owner, file-and-defer handoff)"
- description: "Record a `decisions` item under M1 (the G1 coordination milestone) capturing the investigate:* architecture so the prompt authors share one contract: (1) the `hypothesis` ledger IS the durable tree — each node a hypothesis item, `parentHypothesis` = ancestry, `evidence[]` = validated citations with a `[correct]`/`[incorrect]` prefix convention (research-loop E-item format), `status` open|uncertain|confirmed|wrong, each node `ledgerRefs` its defect `defects:<D>` (Q24/Q27); (2) the DFS/adjudication loop lives in the `/investigate:advance` COMMAND body (subagents cannot spawn subagents), `investigate-explorer` is the read-only evidence-gatherer, no separate reviewer (Q23); (3) HANDOFF MECHANISM — EXPLICITLY file-and-defer, NOT an inline plan loop (resolves R5 criticism #1): on a confirmed root cause, /investigate:advance (a) writes `defects.rootCause`+`suggestedFix`, (b) creates OR extends a plan-flow goal SEEDED from the defect — the goal description embeds the confirmed root cause + suggestedFix + a `ledgerRefs: [defects:<D>]` link, (c) files an `open` question (or report line) pointing the user to run `/plan:advance <G>`, and STOPS. /investigate:advance must NOT re-implement or invoke the planner<->plan-reviewer loop itself (a command cannot run another command's loop, and inline duplication contradicts the Q26 file-and-defer principle the rest of the plan adopts). The subsequent /plan:advance round is what produces reviewed fix tasks that ledgerRef defects:<D> (Q25); (4) CLARIFY-SKIP for the defect-seeded goal (resolves R5 criticism #2): because the root cause is ALREADY confirmed, the seeded goal must enter planning WITHOUT a wasted clarifying round. The decision fixes the mechanism: the seeding step writes the confirmed root cause + suggestedFix into the goal so plan-advance has nothing left to clarify, and the planner prompt (T41) explicitly permits skipping the clarifying round when a goal is defect-seeded (carries a defects:<D> ledgerRef + an embedded confirmed root cause). State that /plan:start and /plan:follow-up normally re-open to `clarifying`, but a defect-seeded goal proceeds straight to planning; (5) parallel explorers ONLY when seeding disjoint top-level hypotheses, serial while drilling a branch (Q27). This is the spec the M7 (and the defect-seeding part of M8/T41) tasks implement."
- acceptance: "A `locked` decisions item exists under M1 with ledgerRefs:[goals:G1], stating the five points above — in particular the file-and-defer handoff (no inline plan loop) and the defect-seeded clarify-skip mechanism; subsequent M7 prompt tasks (T37) and the T41 planner edit cite this decision id.

(b) `/investigate:start <defectId>` — resume an existing defect: validate it exists and is non-terminal, then hand to /investigate:advance. Include Provenance, a session-log write for the advance handoff (like plan/start.md), and a Report telling the user the defect id D, milestone, and to run /investigate:advance D to continue. Do NOT restate the advance loop logic — invoke it."

Since plan-reviewer writes its review item directly, give it the contract: in-scope plan defects stay `criticism`; out-of-scope/pre-existing faults are reported in the review so the orchestrator (/plan:advance) files them as open `defects` items (severity from the reviewer) linked to goals:<G> and routed to investigate:* per Q26 (file-and-defer, do NOT block the plan).

- acceptance: |
    Operationally verifiable — every check is a command with an asserted result, run from repo root, output captured in the completion notes:
    (1) No prompt instructs implement to execute a defect directly: `grep -rniE "(execute|implement|run) .*defect" llm/commands/implement llm/agents` returns ZERO matches that direct execution of a defect (tasks remain the only executable unit).
    (2) Fix-task<->defect link convention stated identically: the bidirectional convention string (`ledgerRefs` includes `defects:<D>` on the fix task; `defects.dependsOn` lists the fix-task ids) appears in plan-advance.md and implement/advance.md — `grep -rn "defects:<D>" llm/` shows the same phrasing in both.
    (3) The evidence-prefix convention is identical across investigate prompts: `grep -rn "\[correct\]" llm/commands/investigate llm/agents/investigate-explorer.md` shows the `[correct]`/`[incorrect]` token present in BOTH investigate/advance.md and investigate-explorer.md.
    (4) Handoff is uniformly file-and-defer (no inline-loop language): `grep -rniE "run .*plan-advance.*loop|invoke .*plan:advance" llm/commands/investigate` returns ZERO matches asserting an inline plan loop; investigate/advance.md instead contains the 'run /plan:advance <G>' user-deferral string.
    (5) Defect-seeded clarify-skip present: `grep -rni "defect-seeded" llm/` shows the clarify-skip note in both plan-advance.md (or plan/start/follow-up) and investigate/advance.md.
    (6) `bun run link-prompts` succeeds and `bun run check` is green.
    The written audit records each command and its actual output; a non-empty result on checks (1)/(4) or an empty result on (2)/(3)/(5) is a failure to be fixed within this task.
