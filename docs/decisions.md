- headline: "investigate:* architecture lock (T35) — hypothesis-ledger tree, command-owned loop, file-and-defer handoff, defect-seeded clarify-skip"
- rationale: |
    Design lock the M7 prompt tasks (T36-T39) and the T41 planner edit cite. Five points:
    
    (1) THE TREE = the `hypothesis` ledger. Each node is a hypothesis item; `parentHypothesis` encodes ancestry; `evidence[]` holds validated citations, each prefixed `[correct]`/`[incorrect]` (research-loop E-item convention); `status` is open|uncertain|confirmed|wrong; each node `ledgerRefs` its defect `defects:<D>`.
    
    (2) LOOP OWNER = the `/investigate:advance` COMMAND body (subagents cannot spawn subagents). `investigate-explorer` is a READ-ONLY evidence-gatherer (no ledger writes, no adjudication). No separate reviewer subagent — the command adjudicates.
    
    (3) HANDOFF = FILE-AND-DEFER, never an inline plan loop (resolves R5 #1). On a confirmed root cause, /investigate:advance: (a) writes `defects.rootCause` + `suggestedFix`; (b) creates OR extends a plan-flow goal SEEDED from the defect — the goal description embeds the confirmed root cause + suggestedFix and a `ledgerRefs:[defects:<D>]` link; (c) files an `open` question / report line telling the user to run `/plan:advance <G>`, and STOPS. It MUST NOT re-implement or invoke the planner<->plan-reviewer loop (a command cannot run another command's loop; inline duplication contradicts the file-and-defer principle, Q26).
    
    (4) DEFECT-SEEDED CLARIFY-SKIP (resolves R5 #2). /plan:start and /plan:follow-up normally re-open a goal to `clarifying`. A defect-seeded goal (carries a `defects:<D>` ledgerRef + an embedded confirmed root cause) proceeds STRAIGHT to planning: the seeding writes the confirmed root cause + suggestedFix so plan-advance has nothing left to clarify, and the planner prompt (T41) explicitly permits skipping the clarifying round when a goal is defect-seeded. `defect-seeded` is the grep-able token.
    
    (5) EXPLORER CONCURRENCY = parallel ONLY when seeding disjoint top-level hypotheses; serial while drilling a single branch (Q27).
- alternatives: "Inline plan loop inside /investigate:advance (rejected: a command cannot run another command's loop; duplicates plan-flow; contradicts file-and-defer). Re-clarifying the defect-seeded goal (rejected: root cause already confirmed; wastes a round — R5 #2). A dedicated investigate-reviewer subagent (rejected: the command adjudicates citations itself, mirroring how plan/implement keep the loop in the command)."

- headline: Questions ledger reserved for genuine user-interaction questions; defect triage stays on the defect (no routing-questions)
- rationale: |
    User decision (G2 follow-up #4, item 18 / answers Q54). REFINES K8/Q26 file-and-defer: the 'defer' half must NOT manifest as a `questions` item.
    
    Rule:
    1. The `questions` ledger is RESERVED for genuine questions requiring human interaction (clarifying/decision questions). Orchestrators must NOT create 'routing' questions whose only purpose is to tell the user to run /investigate:start <D>.
    2. /investigate:start already accepts a BARE defect id (intake resume path, ^D\d+$), so it works WITHOUT any question. An `open` defect linked via ledgerRefs is already discoverable by ledger query — no pointer-question needed.
    3. The triage/deferral note (severity rationale, suggestedFix, 'out-of-scope, triage later') lives ON the defect record itself (its description/suggestedFix fields), NOT in a separate question.
    
    Flow changes (item 18 fix tasks):
    - llm/commands/implement/advance.md §3 (reviewer defects[] file-and-defer): file the `open` defect (with the triage note in its fields) ONLY; DELETE the step that creates a 'run /investigate:start <D>' open question.
    - llm/commands/plan/advance.md auto-investigate routing + llm/agents/plan-reviewer.md: same — file the defect, never a routing question.
    - Keep file-and-defer's NON-blocking property (defects still don't block the in-scope task; still gate milestone archival until terminal).
    - One-time cleanup: retire existing routing questions Q52/Q53 (fold their D3/D4/D5/D6 triage notes into those defect records).
    
    K8 points 1,2,4,5 unaffected; K12 (auto-investigate from plan:*) unaffected — it already derives its worklist by LEDGER QUERY (open defects linked goals:<G>), not from questions, so dropping routing-questions does not break auto-investigate discovery.
