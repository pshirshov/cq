- title: Fix D13 (TUI nav perf via memo boundaries) + D23 (multi-step-form test flake)
- description: |
    DEFECT-SEEDED goal (linked defects:D13, D23) — both root causes CONFIRMED by the /advance investigate round (2026-06-03; hypothesis tree H9-H13 + runtime/git evidence), so this goal enters `planning` directly and SKIPS clarifying (K8 pt4 / K12). plan-advance should produce reviewed FIX TASKS directly. Both fix units are FILE-DISJOINT (ledger-tui src vs test) → parallel-safe.
    
    === FIX UNIT A — D13 (medium): TUI ~500ms per cursor move ===
    CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE (H9+H10; H11/H12 refuted by measurement): the residual per-cursor-move latency is a FIXED, N-INDEPENDENT cost, NOT the O(N) work T85 already removed. Every cursor move calls patchTop({cursor})→setStack (app.tsx:398-404, 830-832) re-rendering the ENTIRE App; there is NO React.memo boundary anywhere in app.tsx, so ScrollList/ContentPane/Markdown all re-execute each keystroke (H9). T85's itemsDerived useMemo (app.tsx:743-760) memoized only the O(N) LIST builders — no memo boundary, never covered the detail pane. ContentPane (app.tsx:1325) re-parses the selected item's markdown unconditionally each render via Markdown→parseBlocks (markdownText.tsx:142-146, no useMemo, not React.memo) and rebuilds field order + estimateLines (app.tsx:1369-1408) (H10). Runtime measurement (debug/20260603-101700-d13-navperf.tsx, ink-testing-library): per-move latency FLAT in N (54.7ms@N=25 / 57.8ms@N=100 / 54.7ms@N=400); the selected item's markdown re-parse DOUBLES per-move cost (empty-desc 28.6ms vs long-md 55.4ms @ N=400). Residual O(N) sites (H11) = 32µs@N=400 — negligible; ink stdout throttle-capped 34ms (H12) — not dominant.
    SUGGESTED FIX: (1) HIGHEST LEVERAGE — wrap Markdown in React.memo + memoize the parse useMemo(()=>parseBlocks(text),[text]) (markdownText.tsx:142-143); removes the ~50% markdown amplifier. (2) wrap ContentPane and ScrollList in React.memo with referentially-stable props; hoist viewItems=allRows.map(...) (app.tsx:1009) into the itemsDerived useMemo for a stable array ref. (3) optionally memoize the relationship resolvers (app.tsx:1389-1390) keyed on (cur.item.id, viewItems) — low impact. REGRESSION GUARD: a navMemo-style test exercising the DEFECTS/HYPOTHESIS ledger with LONG MARKDOWN fields, instrumenting parseBlocks/render counts, asserting a pure cursor move does not re-parse unchanged markdown / does not re-run a memoized ContentPane. (The existing navMemo test used a TASKS ledger with short fields — why it missed this.) Scope: packages/ledger-tui/src/{app.tsx,markdownText.tsx} + test. DISJOINT from D23.
    
    === FIX UNIT B — D23 (medium): multi-step-form test flakes ===
    CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE (H13): advance() helper (packages/ledger-tui/test/app.test.tsx:201-209) uses a fixed ms=1500 wall-clock deadline as its ONLY settle budget; under CPU contention a slow render misses it and advance() throws. The 'creates an item via the multi-step form' test (app.test.tsx:450-467) chains FOUR advance() calls with no explicit per-test timeout (bun 5000ms default). Verified byte-identical base→HEAD: T130 (bfa70ed) fixed other sites with poll-until-condition but touched neither advance() nor this test. Residual of the D20 timing-budget class.
    SUGGESTED FIX: fold the file's existing poll-until-condition idiom into advance() — keep its h.frame() polling, replace the tight ms=1500 deadline with a generous budget (~2000-5000ms, cf. waitForFrame), AND give the multi-step-form test an explicit generous per-test timeout mirroring the scroll test's 20_000ms (app.test.tsx:578). Scope: packages/ledger-tui/test/app.test.tsx only. DISJOINT from D13.
    
    Repo gate: bun run check (deterministic under concurrent full-suite load). No new ledgers. NOTE: marking D13/D23 resolved uses status `resolved` (valid on the current defect schema).
- grounding: "Both root causes confirmed this session by the /advance investigate round. D13: hypothesis nodes H9 (confirmed — full unmemoized re-render), H10 (confirmed — markdown re-parse), H11 (wrong — O(N) negligible, 32µs@N=400), H12 (wrong — ink draw throttle-capped). Runtime evidence: debug/20260603-101700-d13-navperf.tsx (ink-testing-library micro-bench + end-to-end per-move timing). Static citations validated against source: app.tsx:398-404/743-760/830-832/1009/1325/1369-1408/1389-1390, markdownText.tsx:142-146/75-140/23-64, relationships.ts:69/108-142. NO React.memo anywhere in app.tsx (full-file read). D23: hypothesis H13 (confirmed). advance() at app.test.tsx:201-209 (fixed ms=1500); multi-step test at :450-467 (4x advance, no per-test timeout); poll-until helpers waitFor/waitForFrame at :173-190; scroll-test 20_000ms precedent at :554-578. Byte-identical base→HEAD verified via git (bfa70ed^ vs HEAD diff of advance() = IDENTICAL; T130 diff grep count 0 for advance()/multi-step). Tests: bun:test + ink-testing-library (TUI). Gate bun run check."

### G11 — planned

- title: "Agent-ergonomic ledger MCP: state-overview endpoint + better tool/field descriptions"
- description: |
    GREENFIELD tooling improvement to the ledger MCP server (@cq/ledger-mcp + @cq/ledger). USER REQUEST (verbatim): "the beginning of [the /advance] session looked suboptimal" — deriving ledger state at the start of a run took many ledger calls — "probably we should add some descriptions somewhere and/or add some endpoints more convenient for the agents."
    
    CONCRETE EVIDENCE from this session's /advance bootstrap (the pain to fix):
    1. Deriving the three /advance detection predicates (P-investigate = actionable defects; P-plan = movable-phase goals; P-implement = DAG-ready tasks; + open-questions gate) took ~13 read-only ledger calls before the orchestrator had "a complete, authoritative picture of ledger state."
    2. fetch_ledger returns the ENTIRE ledger including long description/rootCause/grounding fields — the goals ledger came back 51.8KB and the questions ledger 142.7KB, BOTH overflowing the tool-output token limit and forcing a fallback to fts_search. There is no compact/headline-only/summary projection.
    3. The fts_search status-filter syntax was non-obvious: the inline form `(status:open OR status:wip)` returned empty and had to be cross-checked against the dedicated `status:` parameter and a known-populated sanity value before the agent trusted it. The query language (qualifiers, the status param vs inline filter, terminal-vs-active semantics) is under-documented at the point of use.
    4. There is NO single "ledger state overview / actionable-work snapshot" endpoint: each predicate needs its own cross-ledger query, and there is no one call that answers "what is actionable right now" (open/non-terminal items grouped by ledger + phase, open questions, ready tasks).
    5. ARCHIVE FOOTGUN (surfaced this session): a defect (D22) the user accidentally set `resolved` was swept into the archive by the auto-archive sweep, and there is NO un-archive / reopen-terminal operation (terminal statuses have no outgoing transition; archive_milestone has no inverse). Recovery required re-filing the item under a new id (D24).
    
    CANDIDATE DIRECTIONS (for clarifying/planning to refine + the planner to scope — NOT locked here):
    - a compact agent-oriented STATE-OVERVIEW / snapshot endpoint (e.g. counts + ids grouped by ledger×status, or an /advance-predicate-shaped summary) returning the actionable set in ONE call;
    - a summary/projection mode for fetch_ledger (headline+status+id only, omit long fields) and/or pagination, so it never overflows token limits;
    - improved TOOL and FIELD DESCRIPTIONS — especially the fts query language (status filter param vs inline, active-vs-archived, terminal semantics), surfaced where the agent reads them (the server `instructions` and per-tool descriptions);
    - possibly an un-archive / reopen-terminal capability (or a guard so the auto-archive sweep cannot act on a just-changed/erroneous terminal status);
    - consider whether the convenience belongs in the MCP server (new tools) vs. the flow prompts (better-documented query recipes) vs. both.
    
    Scope: @cq/ledger-mcp (tool surface + server instructions) and/or @cq/ledger (store query helpers); the frontends are pure MCP clients (any new read tool must be exposed over MCP). Repo gate: bun run check. NOTE: this is the IMPROVEMENT goal only; the restored test-quality defect D24 (ex-D22) is tracked separately under M39 and is NOT part of this goal.
    
    ## Follow-up (2026-06-03) — three added features
    USER REQUEST (verbatim): "we need another feature: accidental click protection in web ui. all the transition buttons (state transitions plus pick answer/as recommended/save answer) should be protected. My idea: click and hold for 1s with a progress bar. also we need to create a new ledger - we could call it "handoffs" - every time the orchestrator stops, it should record reason there with explanation. all states are terminal:ledgers- drained|illness-detected|answers-required, maybe smth else ; also: we should extend ledger schemas with a field linking item to its session log/logs (everywhere where it makes sense)"
    
    Three distinct GREENFIELD features folded into G11:
    F1) ACCIDENTAL-CLICK PROTECTION (web UI): every state-mutating action button — the state-transition buttons AND the answer-affecting buttons (per-suggestion 'pick', 'as recommended', 'save answer'/'save & mark answered') — gated behind a CLICK-AND-HOLD interaction (~1s) with a visible PROGRESS BAR, so a stray click cannot mutate state; the action fires only on a completed hold. Scope: @cq/ledger-web (button affordance + hold/progress UX, happy-dom-testable). CLARIFY: exact hold duration; whether destructive-only vs ALL action buttons; cancel-on-release; keyboard-accessibility/non-mouse path; whether the TUI needs a parallel confirm affordance or web-only.
    F2) NEW 'handoffs' LEDGER: a new CANONICAL ledger recording, every time an orchestrator flow STOPS, the stop reason + an explanation. Proposed ALL-TERMINAL status set: drained | illness-detected | answers-required (+ possibly more — the user said 'maybe smth else'). CLARIFY: the full status enum; the item shape (status=reason + explanation/context + refs to the goals/defects/questions that caused the stop + maybe the session); WHICH flows write it and at WHICH stop points (/advance DRAINED/BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS/MIXED report maps naturally to drained/answers-required/…; implement/plan/investigate stops too); whether it is purely append-only history; relation to the /advance end-of-run report categories. NOTE CLAUDE.md says 'don't create_ledger unless asked' — here the USER explicitly asked, so a new CANONICAL_LEDGERS entry is in scope.
    F3) SESSION-LOG LINK FIELD: extend ledger item schemas with a field linking an item to its session-log file(s) under docs/logs/ (the per-subagent <timestamp>-<agent-id>.md logs the flows already write), 'everywhere where it makes sense'. CLARIFY: which ledgers get the field (tasks/defects/reviews/goals/hypothesis/handoffs?); field name + type (string[] of log paths or agent-ids?); who populates it and when (the orchestrator that writes the log already knows the agent-id ↔ item mapping); whether the TUI/web should render it as a link/relationship.
    
    All three extend the agent-ergonomics/observability theme (handoffs ledger + session-log links make orchestrator runs auditable; click-protection hardens the web client against stray mutations). Repo gate: bun run check; frontends stay pure MCP clients; any new ledger/field lands via @cq/ledger CANONICAL_LEDGERS (+ TUI/web rendering where relevant).
- grounding: |
    Repo grounding (G11 — confirmed at planning entry, 2026-06-03).
    
    CONFIRMED SCHEMA FACTS (packages/ledger/src/constants.ts):
    - CANONICAL_LEDGERS = 8 entries: milestones, defects, tasks, hypothesis, questions, decisions, goals, reviews (constants.ts:309-318). A new `handoffs` entry appends here (idPrefix HO — M/D/T/H/Q/K/G/R taken).
    - COMMON_REF_FIELDS (constants.ts:92-99) = {sourceRefs, blockedBy, dependsOn, ledgerRefs, tags, suggestedModel}; spread into defects/tasks/hypothesis/questions/decisions. NOT in goals/reviews (bespoke field sets).
    - ALL-TERMINAL precedent = REVIEWS_SCHEMA (constants.ts:286-302): both statuses terminal, empty transition arrays, bespoke fields {summary,new_questions,criticism,ledgerRefs,tags,sourceRefs}, idPrefix R.
    - sessionLogs (Q86 answer) goes on WORK-producing ledgers ONLY: tasks, reviews, defects, hypothesis, goals, handoffs. NOT questions/decisions. Adding to COMMON_REF_FIELDS would also hit questions/decisions, so it must be added per-schema (defects/tasks/hypothesis via inline field; goals/reviews/handoffs via their bespoke field sets) — NOT via COMMON_REF_FIELDS.
    
    CONFIRMED PROJECTION BUILDING BLOCK (packages/ledger/src/columns.ts): LONG_FIELD_DENYLIST = {description,rationale,criticism,context,alternatives,evidence,completion,answer,rootCause,suggestedFix,fix} (columns.ts:35-47); ALWAYS_SHOWN_COLUMNS={id,status,summary}; SUMMARY_SOURCE_FIELDS={headline,title,question}. fetch_ledger projection (Q76) reuses LONG_FIELD_DENYLIST to omit long fields. Snapshot stub summary (Q75) = headline??title??question??summary (the summarize() precedence already used by frontends).
    
    CONFIRMED TOOL SURFACE (packages/ledger/src/mcp/ledgerTools.ts): '14 tools' hardcoded in the header comment (ledgerTools.ts:7) AND in packages/ledger-mcp/src/main.ts; LEDGER_TOOL_NAMES is asserted by tests. New tools (Q80: minimal new tools): snapshot, reopen-item, unarchive-item, read-log → 18; fetch_ledger gains projection+pagination PARAMS (no new tool). Every agent-facing capability MUST be an MCP tool (pure-client frontends). QUERY_LANGUAGE_HELP already embedded in fts_search description + SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS (main.ts:164).
    
    TERMINAL/ARCHIVE (Q78): terminal statuses have [] outgoing transitions; reopen-terminal needs a guard-bypassing store op (move terminal→chosen non-terminal). archiveMilestone has no inverse; un-archive needs a store method restoring from ./archive/<ledger>/<id>.md. BOTH wanted; sweep-guard DEFERRED.
    
    FTS ANOMALY (Q77): reproduce-first the empty `(status:open OR status:wip)` result over a populated ledger (query.ts OR-of-qualifiers evaluator vs the dedicated status: param — two code paths). Failing test FIRST; if real defect → fix task + defects record (file-and-defer); else document.
    
    WEB (packages/ledger-web/src/App.tsx, Q81/Q82): ALL state-mutating buttons get a hold gate via ONE reusable HoldButton (per-button requireHold default true). Buttons: DetailPanel save (status transition + field edits), create-mode +item/+milestone save, BatchAnswerModal {batch-answer-submit, batch-answer-as-recommended, batch-pick-suggestion-N}, detail-panel answerBox buttons. HOLD_MS=1000 named constant; release-before-complete cancels+resets; keyboard = hold Enter/Space (keydown arms+starts progress, keyup-before-threshold cancels); WEB-ONLY (no TUI). happy-dom: uncontrolled inputs+refs; drive hold tests with FAKE TIMERS + dispatched pointer/key events.
    
    HANDOFFS (Q83/Q84/Q85): statuses drained|answers-required|mixed|illness-detected (all terminal), idPrefix HO. SEPARATE field handoffReasons: string[] explaining a 'mixed' stop (e.g. [drained,answers-required]). Item shape: summary (required) + flow (advance|plan|implement|investigate) + ledgerRefs + blockingQuestions (id[]) + handoffReasons (string[]) + sessionLogs (string[]) + tags + sourceRefs; append-only; intrinsic author/session/createdAt. WRITERS: each per-flow command writes a handoff when run STANDALONE; chained under /advance the sub-flow SUPPRESSES its handoff and /advance writes the single run-level record — requires amending advance.md §Provenance to permit exactly that one handoffs write.
    
    SESSION-LOG VIEWER (Q87, DEVIATION): sessionLogs populated by the command that writes the log, in the SAME update_item recording the outcome. Frontends MUST render sessionLogs as CLICKABLE links opening a POPUP showing log CONTENT → requires a NEW bounded MCP read-log tool (web is pure MCP client, cannot read docs/ directly). In-app log-viewer + MCP log-read tool ARE in scope.
    
    GATE: bun run check (test+typecheck+lint).

- title: "Fix D24: make the 's'-key-inert archived-item test regression-sensitive"
- description: |
    DEFECT-SEEDED goal (defect:D24, ex-D22) — root cause CONFIRMED by the /advance investigate round (H14 + orchestrator-validated citations), so this goal enters `planning` directly and SKIPS clarifying (K8 pt4 / K12). plan-advance should produce ONE reviewed FIX TASK directly.
    
    CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE (H14): the "'s' key is inert on an archived item" test (packages/ledger-tui/test/app.test.tsx:959-986) asserts ONLY f.toContain('[archived]') (:982) and f.toContain('archived task') (:984) — both overlay-INSENSITIVE ('[archived]' = path-header app.tsx:934-939; 'archived task' = list-pane row app.tsx:1069). The status overlay replaces ONLY the content-pane Box (app.tsx:1071-1073: overlay!==null ? <Overlays/> : contentEl), so if the `!cursorInArchive` guard on the 's' handler (app.tsx:803 content-focus / :838 list-focus) were removed, the status SelectList would open in the content pane yet both assertions would still pass — the test cannot catch the regression. The sibling 'e'-inert test (:1008) asserts 'read-only' (a content-pane badge the overlay replaces) and IS regression-sensitive — the model.
    
    SUGGESTED FIX: after pressing 's', add a content-pane-sensitive assertion mirroring the 'e' test — assert the SelectList '› ' cursor marker (app.tsx:1291-1296) is ABSENT and/or the read-only badge '[archived · read-only]' (app.tsx:1424) is still PRESENT, so the test FAILS if 's' wrongly opens the status overlay on an archived row. Use the existing listSide(frame) helper (~test L1264) pattern for a content-pane slice, or assert '› ' absent from the whole frame. Keep the existing waitForFrame settle. Scope: packages/ledger-tui/test/app.test.tsx ONLY (test-quality fix, no product change). Repo gate: bun run check. NOTE: do NOT mark D24 resolved here — the implement-flow merge-back owns closure.

- title: Fix D25/D26/D27 (G11 follow-up code-quality cleanup)
- description: |
    DEFECT-SEEDED goal (clarify-skipped, K8 pt4) for three confirmed, low-severity, disjoint code-quality defects filed during the G11 build. Linked defects (their ledgerRefs point back here): D25, D26, D27. All three root causes are CONFIRMED with [correct]-validated citations; each fix is small + well-specified. Three disjoint file scopes → naturally parallel fix tasks. The fix TASKS must each ledgerRef their defect (defects:D25/D26/D27) so the implement orchestrator can close the defect on merge (goals has no ledgerRefs field).
    
    === D26 (read_log symlink-escape hardening — the only behavioural fix; reproduce-first) ===
    CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE: FsLedgerStore.readLog (packages/ledger/src/store/FsLedgerStore.ts:1257-1267) validates containment with a LEXICAL path.resolve(logsDir, relPath) + startsWith(logsDir + path.sep) check and never calls fs.realpath; fs.readFile(resolved) then follows symlinks. A symlink inside docs/logs/ whose target escapes the root passes the lexical guard and is read.
    SUGGESTED FIX: after the lexical guard, fs.realpath(resolved) and re-assert realpath === logsDir || startsWith(logsDir + path.sep); throw the same escape error otherwise. Catch ENOENT so a genuinely missing file still surfaces the normal not-found error (do NOT mask it). ~3 lines. ADD a regression test FIRST: create a symlink under docs/logs pointing outside the root, assert read_log rejects it (must fail before the fix, pass after).
    
    === D25 (stale eslint-disable — lint hygiene) ===
    CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE: navRenderBytes.test.tsx:291 carries `// eslint-disable-next-line no-console` over the console.log at :292, but no-console is not enabled in eslint.config.js, so the directive is unused → eslint warning (non-fatal).
    SUGGESTED FIX: remove the stale `// eslint-disable-next-line no-console` comment at packages/ledger-tui/test/navRenderBytes.test.tsx:291 (keep the console.log).
    
    === D27 (handoff CHAINED-trigger wording — prompt clarity) ===
    CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE: the */advance.md handoff CHAINED branch (plan/advance.md:283, implement/advance.md:290) names only /advance; investigate/advance.md:282 adds /plan:advance; none covers a /<flow>:start or /<flow>:follow-up inline pass, leaving correctness reliant on start.md/follow-up.md external override.
    SUGGESTED FIX: reword each of the 3 */advance.md CHAINED triggers to fire on ANY wrapping flow command — 'CHAINED INLINE by any wrapping flow command (/advance, /plan:advance, or a /<flow>:start / /<flow>:follow-up that runs this pass inline) → SUPPRESS; the outermost wrapper owns the single handoff write.' Prompt-only.
    
    GATE: bun run check green. Frontends stay pure MCP clients. D26 requires reproduce-first (failing symlink test before the realpath fix).

- title: Fix D28 (readLog check-then-read TOCTOU)
- description: |
    DEFECT-SEEDED goal (clarify-skipped, K8 pt4) for D28 (CONFIRMED H18) — a low-severity, pre-existing TOCTOU in FsLedgerStore.readLog surfaced by the T158 reviewer. Linked defect (its ledgerRefs point back here): D28. The fix TASK must ledgerRef defects:D28 + goals:G14 (goals has no ledgerRefs field) so the implement orchestrator closes D28 on merge.
    
    CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE: readLog computes `real = fs.realpath(resolved)` and validates `real` against realLogsDir inside a try block, but reads `fs.readFile(resolved)` (the non-canonical, symlink-bearing path) after the block. A symlink swapped between the realpath check and the readFile follows to its new target at read time (check-then-read TOCTOU). T158 closed the persistent-symlink escape; this transient race remains. Low severity: read-only tool confined to the server's own docs/logs; an actor able to swap an in-docs/logs symlink already controls returned content (no privilege escalation).
    
    SUGGESTED FIX: hoist `real` out of the try block and read the validated CANONICAL path — `fs.readFile(real)` instead of `fs.readFile(resolved)`. `real` has no symlink components, so the read follows nothing and the validated path === the read path, closing the TOCTOU. PRESERVE ENOENT: when realpath(resolved) throws ENOENT (genuinely missing file), fall back to reading `resolved` so the normal not-found error still surfaces (do NOT mask it). Add a regression test (e.g. assert the canonical path is read, or a post-check symlink swap does not escape). ~2-3 lines + test. Keep the existing D26 escape-rejection + symlinked-root + ENOENT tests green.
    
    GATE: bun run check green. Scope: packages/ledger/src/store/FsLedgerStore.ts (readLog) + test.
- grounding: "Verified against packages/ledger/src/store/FsLedgerStore.ts (main, current tree). readLog() at L1251-1302: `resolved = path.resolve(this.logsDir, relPath)` (L1257); lexical containment check L1258-1265; then a try block (L1276-1294) computes `const real = await fs.realpath(resolved)` (L1277) and validates `real` against `realLogsDir` (L1285-1289) — but `real` is BLOCK-SCOPED to the try and the actual read at L1296 is `const buf = await fs.readFile(resolved)`, the non-canonical symlink-bearing path. Confirms H18 TOCTOU. The existing catch (L1290-1294) already swallows ENOENT (`if (code !== 'ENOENT') throw err`) to let a genuinely-missing file fall through to readFile — so the ENOENT-fallback semantics the fix must preserve already exist at the catch. Fix: hoist `real` to a `let` outside the try, assign inside; after the try, `await fs.readFile(real ?? resolved)` so a missing file (real undefined, ENOENT-swallowed) still reads `resolved` and surfaces the normal not-found error, while the happy path reads the validated canonical `real`. Sibling protections assertWithinDocsRoot (L1326) + the D26 realpath re-assert are the model. Tests live alongside in packages/ledger (D26 escape-rejection / symlinked-root / ENOENT suite must stay green)."

- title: Explorer RW access + pluggable parallel reviewers (cq.toml)
- description: |
    Plan two new features for the coding-agent flow harness.
    
    FEATURE 1 — Explorer read/write access in investigate:* flow:
    Sometimes explorers in the investigate flow might need R/W rights to investigate better. Options under consideration:
    (a) allow explorers writes (bash, etc.) but instruct them to attempt to avoid that unless necessary; or
    (b) allow explorers to RETURN an RW permission request so the orchestrator can re-run the explorer with extended permissions.
    The planner may propose an alternative/third approach.
    
    FEATURE 2 — Pluggable parallel reviewers via cq.toml:
    The `pi` coding agent is available in this sandbox, with Codex and X.AI integrations configured. Goal: be able to use it to run reviews in parallel with, or instead of, Claude reviews.
    - Add a root-directory config file, e.g. `cq.toml`, with a section defining reviewers, e.g. `reviewers = ["claude:opus", "pi:grok-build", "pi:gpt-5.5"]`.
    - When defined, for every review the orchestrator launches all configured reviewers in parallel, then reconciles their outputs.
    - The config file defines the defaults; the user can modify the ACTIVE reviewer set on the fly by saying so (e.g. a command `/cq:reviewers use grok and opus only`).
- grounding: |
    Grounded against the actual harness (2026-06-05) AND folded the Q88-Q93 answers into a concrete design. Assets live under nix/pkg/cq-assets/{commands,agents}/, fanned by nix/hm/dev-llm.nix (mergedCommands -> Claude commands + Codex ~/.codex/prompts + Pi promptTemplates; mergedAgents -> Claude ONLY). The Bun workspace is nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/ (packages/ledger{,-live,-mcp,-tui,-web}); `bun run check` = tsc -b && eslint . && bun test. programs.mcp.servers registry in dev-llm.nix currently wires codegraph + ledger; a new MCP server is added there.
    
    FEATURE 1 design (answers Q88=c, Q89=as-recommended): TWO-TIER explorer. Keep investigate-explorer.md read-only/no-worktree EXACTLY as-is. Add a NEW agent investigate-prober.md (Bash-enabled, runs in an ISOLATED throwaway git worktree) dispatched by commands/investigate/advance.md ONLY when an explorer's returned JSON sets a new optional `probeRequest` field (what it needs to RUN + why). The probe is READ + EXECUTE (repros, bun test, builds, git inspection) inside the throwaway worktree; NO persisted edits to the main checkout; LOCAL-ONLY, no network by default. Scope = investigate:* flow ONLY. The orchestrator harvests the prober's evidence (same citation-revalidation trust model) then DISCARDS the worktree. The explorer's existing fenced-json contract {hypothesisId, evidence[], lean, notes} gains the optional `probeRequest`; the prober emits the SAME evidence-json shape. investigate-explorer's disallowedTools already blocks Bash/worktree; the prober is a separate def so the read-only invariant that makes explorer citations trustworthy stays intact.
    
    FEATURE 2 design (answers Q90, Q91, Q92, Q93): Per-repo root cq.toml read via a NEW `cq-config` MCP server (Q92 — the user explicitly wants an MCP endpoint, NOT a prompt-side Read). cq.toml schema (Q92): an [aliases] table mapping alias->"<harness>:<model>" (e.g. codex="pi:gpt-5.5", grok="pi:grok-build", opus="claude:opus-4.8[1m]") PLUS reviewers=["codex","grok","opus"] (a list of ALIASES, resolved through [aliases]). cq-config MCP exposes a tool (e.g. get_reviewers / get_config) the orchestrators call to obtain the resolved reviewer set; lives as a new package under nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/packages (mirrors ledger-mcp) and is registered in programs.mcp.servers in dev-llm.nix. INVOCATION (Q90): claude:<model> -> native Agent subagent (today's plan-reviewer/implement-reviewer path, UNCHANGED). Non-Claude alias -> orchestrator shells out via Bash to `pi` ONLY (NOT codex CLI): `pi -p <prompt>` selecting provider+model (grok-build via grok-build provider; gpt-5.5 via the openai-codex provider already configured in pi). The pi reviewer must emit the SAME structured-JSON contract the native reviewer returns (plan: a reviews-item-shaped json {summary,new_questions,criticism,defects}; implement: {taskId,verdict,criticism,questions,defects,rationale}). Because pi/codex don't get AGENT files (mergedAgents is Claude-only), the reviewer RUBRIC must be extracted into a SHARED reviewer PROMPT both the native subagent and the pi shellout consume (a commands/* entry is auto-delivered to pi as a promptTemplate). RECONCILIATION (Q91 -> CONFIRMED by Q95 2026-06-05): STRICTEST-WINS verdict (any reviewer's revise/disapprove blocks; go-ahead/approve requires unanimity) + UNION of all reviewers' criticism/questions/defects, each finding tagged by source reviewer (e.g. a [grok] / [codex] prefix), aggregated into the SINGLE reviews item the round records. Q95 explicitly confirmed strictest-wins+union-with-source-tags as the intended semantics over majority-vote / designated-primary, so T175/T176 stand as written (no material change). ON-THE-FLY OVERRIDE (Q93=session-only): /cq:reviewers (commands/cq/reviewers.md, net-new /cq:* namespace) sets the ACTIVE reviewer set for the CURRENT chained run ONLY — NO durable override file, NO gitignored state, NO ledger item. The user re-states it each fresh /plan:advance or /implement:advance. cq-config provides the DEFAULT set from cq.toml; the session override (when stated) supersedes it in-memory for that run. Feature is OFF (single native Claude reviewer, today's exact behaviour) when cq.toml is absent. SPIKE-FIRST (Q90 recommendation): the FIRST task verifies `pi -p` runs non-interactively in this sandbox and emits parseable output, BEFORE the reconciliation tasks depend on it.
    
    R169 (revise) FIXES already folded into the durable plan: (1) T173 gates the native plan-reviewer's reviews-ledger write on mode — direct write ONLY in unconfigured single-reviewer fallback; RETURN json (write nothing) in configured multi-reviewer mode so the orchestrator writes the SINGLE aggregated item (resolves the T173/T175 double-write). (2) T168/T178 VERIFY the real cq-assets source root before adding link-prompts.ts entries and assert the new symlinks resolve to existing files (not a stale 'llm/' root). (3) T172 ALSO registers cq-config in THIS repo's .mcp.json (not just global dev-llm.nix) so in-repo dogfooding can reach get_reviewers. The stale-'llm/'-root pre-existing fault remains a separately-filed out-of-scope defect (R169 file-and-defer bucket).
    
    Parallel-safety: commands/investigate/advance.md, commands/plan/advance.md, commands/implement/advance.md and dev-llm.nix are each touched by multiple tasks across both features -> serialize same-file edits via dependsOn (R137/R138/R139 precedent). The cq-assets README.md is STALE and must be updated to list the investigate/* assets + the new prober/cq.toml/cq-config/reviewers assets.

- title: Fix D29 — reject empty/whitespace answer on a question's `answered` transition
- description: |
    DEFECT-SEEDED goal (skips clarifying per T35; confirmed root cause embedded). Fix D29: the ledger accepts an empty/whitespace `answer` when a `questions` item transitions to `answered`, violating the invariant that an `answered` question carries a usable answer.
    
    CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE (H19 backend + H20 frontend, all citations validated against source):
    BACKEND (authoritative): QUESTIONS_SCHEMA.answer is `{type:'string', required:false}` with no content/status-conditional constraint (constants.ts:217). The store transition path applyUpdateItem (core.ts:259-291) runs assertTransitionAllowed + an OPTIONAL StatusChangePrecondition + validateFields; validateFields/assertFieldType only type-check (core.ts:831-859), and the precondition hook is wired ONLY for GOALS_LEDGER (FsLedgerStore.ts:571-581). The MCP update_item handler forwards status+fields verbatim (ledgerTools.ts:309-317); its Zod fieldsSchema accepts '' (ledgerTools.ts:171-173).
    FRONTEND (complementary): all four submit paths are unguarded — web detail submitAnswer/HoldButton (App.tsx:2611/2629), web BatchAnswerModal (App.tsx:1732), TUI answer overlay via TextPrompt Enter (TextPrompt.tsx:30-43), TUI BatchAnswerOverlay Enter (app.tsx:1952).
    
    SUGGESTED FIX:
    1. BACKEND (primary/invariant): reject (from != answered) -> (to == answered) on the questions ledger unless the EFFECTIVE answer = (patch.fields?.answer ?? item.fields.answer) is a non-empty trimmed string. Implement as a questions-specific StatusChangePrecondition mirroring assertGoalPhasePreconditions, wired for QUESTIONS_LEDGER in FsLedgerStore.updateItem AND the in-memory store. Reproduce-first: failing test that update_item(Q, status:'answered', fields:{answer:''}) and {answer:'   '} throw, non-empty still succeeds; dual-tests across FsLedgerStore + InMemoryLedgerStore.
    2. FRONTEND (UX): disable 'save & mark answered' when the trimmed answer is empty (web detail HoldButton App.tsx:2629; web BatchAnswerModal App.tsx:1732; TUI TextPrompt Enter / BatchAnswerOverlay Enter), reusing the answerHasText/setAnswerHasText pattern.
    Planning may weigh the targeted precondition (recommended) vs a general FieldSpec extension. Acceptance: `bun run check` green; reproduce-first red/green on the backend guard.
- sourceRefs: ["defects:D29"]
- milestones: ["M54"]
- grounding: "Plan emitted under work milestone M54 (recorded here). Chose the TARGETED questions-specific StatusChangePrecondition (mirroring assertGoalPhasePreconditions, dual-store) over a general FieldSpec/nonEmpty extension — surgical, low-risk, matches the existing goals-only precedent. Backend = authoritative invariant (T162, reproduce-first dual-tests across FsLedgerStore + InMemoryLedgerStore); frontends = pure MCP clients per CLAUDE.md, so web/TUI guards (T163/T164) are complementary UX only and depend on T162. Same-file serialization honored: both web edits (HoldButton + BatchAnswerModal in App.tsx) are folded into ONE task T163 (repo reviewer policy R137/R138/R139); the two TUI edits live in different files so share T164. Codegraph index not loaded for this tree; citations rely on the investigation's source-validated anchors — implementers must re-cite against live source as line numbers may have drifted."

- title: Fix D30 — repoint link-prompts.ts + cq-assets README off the vanished `llm/` root
- description: |
    DEFECT-SEEDED goal (skips clarifying per T35; confirmed root cause embedded). Fix D30: `bun run link-prompts` silently creates 14 dangling `.claude/**` symlinks because the asset tree moved to `nix/pkg/cq-assets/{commands,agents}/` but link-prompts.ts + the cq-assets README still reference the removed `llm/` root.
    
    CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE (H21, all 8 citations re-validated against source):
    The asset tree was relocated to `nix/pkg/cq-assets/{commands,agents}/` and `assets.nix` updated (collectMdIn ./commands/./agents, assets.nix:49-50), but `scripts/link-prompts.ts` was not: its 14 LINKS still set `source: 'llm/commands/...' / 'llm/agents/...'` (link-prompts.ts:29-44) resolved against REPO_ROOT = nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/ (link-prompts.ts:19; package.json:13). `nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/llm` no longer exists. The loop stats only the LINK (`linkExists`/lstat absLink), never the TARGET (absSource); symlink(2) succeeds on a nonexistent target and logs success (link-prompts.ts:46-73) — so dangling links are produced silently. `nix/pkg/cq-assets/README.md:1,10-11,40-42` still documents the old `llm/` root.
    
    SUGGESTED FIX:
    1. Repoint link-prompts.ts LINKS `source:` from `llm/...` onto the real tree: change each `source` to resolve from REPO_ROOT to `../cq-assets/commands/...` / `../cq-assets/agents/...` (preferred — explicit), OR restore a `nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/llm -> ../cq-assets` symlink.
    2. HARDEN the loop: assert each `absSource` exists (test -e / lstat) BEFORE `symlink`, throwing loud on a missing target. Add reproduce-first coverage (or a `--check` mode) asserting every produced link resolves.
    3. Update `nix/pkg/cq-assets/README.md` (title, convention block, Three-consumers / Claude-link tables) to the `nix/pkg/cq-assets/...` layout.
    Acceptance: reproduce-first (a test/assertion that FAILS on the current dangling output, passes after); after fix `bun run link-prompts` yields only non-dangling links (every target `test -e`); `bun run check` green.
    
    NOTE coordination with G15: G15's tasks T168/T178 ADD new link entries (investigate-prober, /cq:*) and were revised to verify their source root independently — sequence so D30's repoint lands first or the two are reconciled to avoid edit collisions on link-prompts.ts.
- sourceRefs: ["defects:D30"]
- grounding: "Re-validated against source 2026-06-05. scripts/link-prompts.ts (nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/): REPO_ROOT = dirname(script)/.. = nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/ (L19); run via package.json:13 `link-prompts`. 14 LINKS (L29-44) set source:'llm/commands/...' / 'llm/agents/...'; nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/llm does NOT exist. The creation loop (L56-74) stats only the LINK (linkExists/lstat absLink, L64-65), NEVER the target absSource (L58), so symlink(2) (L72) succeeds on a nonexistent target and L73 logs success -> 14 dangling .claude/** symlinks produced silently. Real assets live at nix/pkg/cq-assets/{commands,agents}/ (assets.nix:49-50 collectMdIn ./commands/./agents); cq-assets is a SIBLING of cq-ledgers, so from REPO_ROOT the correct source is `../cq-assets/commands/...` / `../cq-assets/agents/...`. Explicit repoint preferred over restoring a hidden `llm -> ../cq-assets` symlink. nix/pkg/cq-assets/README.md still documents `llm/` root: title L1, convention block L9-13, current-assets table L18-29 (commands/.. relative, OK but header context stale), three-consumers Claude-link table L38-49 (llm/ sources), narrative L31,54.

- title: Merge cq-config into ledger MCP + pluggable parallel planners
- description: |
    Two follow-up changes to the just-built G15 harness work (Feature 2 / M56).
    
    PART 1 — Consolidate cq-config into the ledger MCP (scope correction):
    The G15 build created a SEPARATE `cq-config` MCP server (package `@cq/config-mcp` + `cq-config-mcp` bin + Nix package `.#cq-config-mcp` + registrations in dev-llm.nix `programs.mcp.servers` and this repo's `.mcp.json`). The user wanted just a cq-config TOOL added to the EXISTING ledger MCP server — NOT a standalone server. ACTION: merge the cq-config functionality (the `get_reviewers`/`get_config` tools over the `@cq/config` parser) INTO the ledger MCP server as tool(s), then REMOVE the unnecessary standalone server: the `@cq/config-mcp` package, the `cq-config-mcp` bin, the `.#cq-config-mcp` flake attr/derivation, and the dev-llm.nix + .mcp.json `cq-config` server registrations. The `@cq/config` parser package can stay (it is the reusable library); only the separate SERVER/transport is removed. All consumers (the reconciliation wiring in plan/advance.md + implement/advance.md + /cq:reviewers) must be updated to call the tool on the ledger MCP (e.g. `mcp__ledger__get_reviewers`) instead of `mcp__cq-config__*`.
    
    PART 2 — Pluggable parallel PLANNERS (mirror parallel reviewers):
    We now support parallel REVIEWERS (cq.toml `reviewers = [...]`, strictest-wins+union reconciliation, `/cq:reviewers` per-session override). Add the SAME capability for PLANNERS: define a default planner set in the config (e.g. `planners = ["claude:opus", "pi:grok-build", ...]`); when defined, the plan flow launches all configured planners in parallel and reconciles their plans; the user can modify the ACTIVE planner set per-session with a command (e.g. `/cq:planners use grok and opus only`), exactly the way `/cq:reviewers` works. The planner reconciliation semantics (how N parallel plans are merged into one) are for clarifying/planning to settle.
- sourceRefs: ["goals:G15"]
- grounding: |
    Grounded against just-merged G15/M56 artifacts (HEAD f2b69be). [v2 — folds in Q97–Q102 answers + a second grounding pass on ledgerTools.ts/cq-config-mcp/main.ts/cq-config parser/plan-advance.md/reviewers.md/plan+implement advance.md.]
    
    === DECISIONS LOCKED BY ANSWERS ===
    - Q97 (a): port BOTH tools verbatim -> mcp__ledger__get_reviewers + mcp__ledger__get_config (consumer call-sites become 1:1 renames). Tool count 18->20 (PART 1); ->21 after PART 2 adds get_planners.
    - Q98: DELETE the standalone server outright (no shim) AND keep @cq/ledger config-agnostic -> thread a CONFIG capability from @cq/ledger-mcp into the tool factory, mirroring the readLog capability (createLedgerMcpTools(store, readLog?) gains a configCapability? param resolving cq.toml against the store root). => @cq/config becomes a dep of @cq/ledger-MCP (NOT @cq/ledger core).
    - Q99: cq.toml stays at repo root = ledger MCP --cwd/$LEDGER_ROOT; drop the redundant $CQ_CONFIG_ROOT. Schema unchanged except PART 2 adds sibling planners=[].
    - Q100 (CORE): GENERATE-N-then-JUDGE, and the judge must SYNTHESIZE — when non-best planners produced something important, factor those good parts in (NOT blind pick-best). Orchestrator writes only the final synthesized plan.
    - Q101: under model (a), pi:* planners ALLOWED as candidate-emitters (they emit a structured task-DAG via stdout; the orchestrator owns ALL ledger writes). Claude planners run as plan-advance subagents in a new CANDIDATE MODE.
    - Q102: SHARED [aliases] table; sibling planners=[] list; new commands/cq/planners.md mirroring reviewers.md (reuse same fallback map grok->pi:grok-build, opus->claude:opus-4.8[1m], codex->pi:gpt-5.5); add resolvePlanners(); add get_planners tool + a planners field on get_config.
    
    === PART 1 surface (verified) ===
    - @cq/config PARSER lib (packages/cq-config/src/{index,types,config,toml}.ts): loadConfig(repoRoot)->CqConfig|null, resolveReviewers, parseReviewerToken, CQ_CONFIG_FILENAME='cq.toml', HARNESSES=['claude','pi']. STAYS. CqConfig={aliases:Record<string,ReviewerToken>, reviewers:readonly string[]}. parseConfig/parseToml currently reject any top-level key other than 'reviewers' (toml.ts L139-143) — PART 2 must extend BOTH the toml whitelist and CqConfig/parseConfig for 'planners'.
    - @cq/config-mcp STANDALONE SERVER (packages/cq-config-mcp/src/main.ts): raw @modelcontextprotocol/sdk McpServer+StdioServerTransport+registerTool (NOT the claude-agent-sdk tool() shape). Payload builders computeReviewers/computeConfig + ResolvedReviewer/GetReviewersResult/GetConfigResult types are the REUSABLE logic to lift into the merged tool. Root precedence --cwd>$CQ_CONFIG_ROOT>cwd. TO DELETE entirely (server+bin+package dir).
    - MERGE TARGET packages/ledger/src/mcp/ledgerTools.ts: factory createLedgerMcpTools(store, readLog?) returns tool()[] (names auto-prefixed mcp__cq__*). Header documents '18 tools' (L7) + the LEDGER_TOOL_NAMES asserted list (test surface) — both bump to 20 (PART1)/21 (PART2). readLog capability is injected (ReadLogCapability from ./readLog.js, threaded from ledger-mcp buildServer) — the config capability follows the SAME injection pattern. Re-express get_reviewers/get_config in tool()+zod (empty input schema {} as Record<string,never>, jsonResult(...) return) calling computeReviewers/computeConfig against the resolved store root.
    - ledger-mcp/src/main.ts buildServer(store, displayName) -> registerLedgerStdioTools(server, store, readLog); --cwd>$LEDGER_ROOT>cwd. Wire @cq/config here: construct a config capability bound to the resolved root and pass it into the factory (mirror readLog). embedded TUI/web buildServer paths get the same wiring.
    - flake.nix: remove cqConfigMcp derivation (~247-304), packages.cq-config-mcp + apps.cq-config-mcp (~449,494), node-modules FOD fileset+installPhase entries for packages/cq-config-mcp (~59,102,106). @cq/config stays in FOD. Because @cq/config becomes a dep of @cq/ledger-mcp, the ledger-mcp derivation installPhase must add a @cq/config workspace symlink under packages/ledger-mcp/node_modules/@cq/config (mirror the @cq/ledger link), and embedServerClosure for TUI/web likewise. FOD-hash refresh required (set outputHash to 52 A's -> nix build .#node-modules -> paste got: hash).
    - dev-llm.nix: remove cqConfigPkg = ledgerPkgs.cq-config-mcp (~105) + programs.mcp.servers.cq-config (~567-570). piMcpJson keep-alive remap is generic, so removing the entry covers Pi too.
    - .mcp.json: remove the 'cq-config' server entry (~7-10).
    - Consumers (switch mcp__cq-config__get_reviewers/get_config -> mcp__ledger__* + frontmatter allowed-tools): commands/plan/advance.md (frontmatter L4 grants mcp__cq-config__get_reviewers; step 2.1 calls get_reviewers), commands/implement/advance.md (frontmatter L4 grants mcp__cq-config__get_reviewers; reviewer-resolution block), commands/cq/reviewers.md (frontmatter L4 grants both get_reviewers+get_config; steps 1-2 call get_config).
    
    === PART 2 surface (verified) ===
    - Reviewer template = commands/plan/advance.md step 2: 2a single-reviewer fallback (native plan-reviewer writes its own review); 2b multi-reviewer (orchestrator launches ALL reviewers in parallel — claude:* via Agent subagent_type plan-reviewer in 'configured mode' returning JSON; pi:* via Bash `pi -p --no-tools --no-session --provider P --model M '<prompt>'` per K30, strip code fence; reconcile strictest-wins+tagged-union; orchestrator writes the ONE aggregated reviews item). The multi-PLANNER step mirrors 2b STRUCTURE but with generate-N-then-JUDGE+SYNTHESIS reconciliation (NOT strictest-wins, which only works for commensurable verdicts).
    - Native planner agents/plan-advance.md: one state-step per call; disallowedTools Write/Edit/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit/Bash (so candidate mode is READ-ONLY — emits a structured task-DAG JSON in its REPLY, writes no ledger; consistent with its disallow list). Currently SINGLE; gains a CANDIDATE MODE branch (when invoked by the orchestrator as one of N: ground + produce a full candidate plan as fenced JSON {milestones:[...], tasks:[{headline,description,acceptance,suggestedModel,dependsOn,ledgerRefs}], rationale}, write NOTHING).
    - /cq:reviewers (commands/cq/reviewers.md) is the session-only NL override (parses NL->alias names, resolves via cq.toml [aliases] + hardcoded fallback map, echoes active set, writes nothing). /cq:planners mirrors it 1:1 (same fallback map, same SESSION-ONLY semantics, reads get_planners/get_config).
    - KEY: N plans are alternative DAGs, NOT unionable -> generate-N-then-judge+synthesis. The judge is a synthesis step (orchestrator, or a dedicated plan-synthesizer subagent) that PICKS a base candidate AND folds in valuable parts of the others; only that ONE synthesized plan is written to the ledger by the orchestrator. pi:* planners participate as candidate-emitters because the orchestrator owns all writes.

- title: Fix D32 — repoint cq-assets/README.md off the removed cq-config MCP server
- description: "Defect-seeded goal (D32, confirmed root cause H23 — clarification skipped per K8 pt4). CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE: nix/pkg/cq-assets/README.md is the last live consumer documenting the removed standalone cq-config MCP server; staleness confined to the 'Configuration' section — L77 heading '## Configuration — cq.toml and cq-config MCP' and L82-85 prose 'The `cq-config` MCP server exposes `get_reviewers` over the `.mcp.json` interface ...'. After G18 PART 1 the standalone server/package/flake-attr/registrations were deleted and get_reviewers/get_config merged into the ledger MCP (mcp__ledger__*; get_planners added PART 2). SUGGESTED FIX (verbatim): Edit README.md 'Configuration' section ONLY — (1) L77 heading → 'Configuration — cq.toml and the ledger MCP' (or drop the server name); (2) L82-85 prose → cq.toml is parsed by the @cq/config parser and surfaced by the LEDGER MCP server, which exposes get_reviewers/get_config (and get_planners) as mcp__ledger__* over .mcp.json — no standalone cq-config server; optionally note planners mirror reviewers via the shared [aliases] table. Doc-only; bun run check stays green. Linked defect: D32. Single fix task expected; acceptance: README 'Configuration' section repointed to the ledger MCP, no standalone-cq-config-SERVER reference remains in README, bun run check green."

- title: "cq.toml [webui] config + new cq CLI (init/reset/erase)"
- description: |
    Two minor feature requests (greenfield).
    
    FEATURE 1 — `[webui]` section in cq.toml + port auto-increment:
    Add a `[webui]` section to cq.toml with two entries: `host` and `port`. The web UI should read its host/port settings from there. If CLI args (the existing `--host`/`--port` flags) are set, the CLI args MUST be preferred over the cq.toml values. If the configured/requested port is already occupied, the web UI should increment the port number until it finds the first available port, listen on it, and REPORT the actual host/port it ended up listening on to stdout.
    
    FEATURE 2 — new `cq` CLI tool with subcommands:
    Introduce a new CLI tool named `cq` with three subcommands:
    - `cq init` — creates empty ledgers if there are none.
    - `cq reset` — move the ledgers RESET logic OUT of the MCP server and into this subcommand (relocate the existing reset capability from the MCP).
    - `cq erase` — destroys existing ledgers.
    
    Both are described by the user as MINOR feature requests.
- grounding: |
    Grounded read-only against HEAD 32cfe43 (2026-06-06); ANSWERS Q105-Q111 folded in (v2).
    
    Bun workspace = nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/packages/{ledger,ledger-mcp,ledger-web,ledger-tui,cq-config}. bun run check = tsc -b && eslint . && bun test (from nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/). Nix bins packaged in repo-root flake.nix + node-modules FOD.
    
    === ANSWER-DRIVEN DECISIONS (authoritative; supersede v1 recommendations) ===
    - Q105: the user REJECTS the hand-rolled cq-config TOML parser ('do we have a home-baked toml parser??? use a library'). => REPLACE packages/cq-config/src/toml.ts parseToml with a maintained TOML library (smol-toml — pure-TS, TOML 1.0, zero native deps, fits Bun + the FOD model). port MUST be a real integer (the library yields numbers natively). The typed model (config.ts/types.ts) stays; only parseToml's internals + RawToml shape adapt to the library output, keeping the SAME fail-fast boundary (precise error on malformed input / unexpected keys). [webui] = host (string) + port (integer) ONLY.
    - Q106: per-field precedence CLI flag > cq.toml [webui] > built-in default, resolved INDEPENDENTLY for host and port (host default 127.0.0.1, port default 5180). Only PORT auto-increments; host is taken as-is.
    - Q107: bounded port scan (cap ~64 tries) from the resolved port; ALWAYS-ON increment — applies even to an EXPLICIT --port (user: 'Explicit --port should increment too'); on exhausting the cap, fail loudly. Report the ACTUAL bound URL `http://<host>:<port>/` to STDOUT; KEEP the existing human stderr serving line too.
    - Q108: NEW dedicated workspace package packages/cq-cli, bin literally `cq` -> src/main.ts; packaged in flake.nix exactly like ledger-mcp (own derivation + node-modules FOD entry + workspace symlinks for @cq/ledger); ledger root via --cwd > $LEDGER_ROOT > CWD.
    - Q109: keep FsLedgerStore.reset() in @cq/ledger (reusable core); MOVE the CLI wrapper (runReset + ResetIo + ResetOutcome + defaultResetIo + --reset/--yes parsing + main() short-circuit) from packages/ledger-mcp/src/main.ts INTO `cq reset`; REMOVE --reset/--yes from the ledger-mcp binary (accepted breaking CLI change). Reuse the SAME confirmation policy (--yes proceed / TTY prompt / non-TTY refuse exit 2).
    - Q110: init = FsLedgerStore.init()-if-none (idempotent, never overwrites existing data); reset = existing backup+reinit; erase = DESTROY EVERYTHING under the ledger root incl. docs/*.md + ledgers.yaml + archive/ + .backup/ + logs/ + .locks/ AND the cq.toml config file ('erase should erase everything including archives and config') — NO backup, NO reinit, leave nothing. Both destructive cmds (reset, erase) reuse the ResetIo confirmation policy.
    - Q111: G20 EXPLICITLY DEPENDS ON G18 LANDING FIRST (not plan-against-HEAD). The @cq/config parser edits (FEATURE 1 W1) must be sequenced AFTER G18 PART 2 (work milestones M61/M62, currently `planned`) merges, because both edit toml.ts/config.ts/types.ts — and the library swap is a wholesale rewrite of toml.ts that would conflict with G18's planners-whitelist edits. `cq init` does NOT write cq.toml (config authoring stays the user's; consistent with loadConfig returning null when absent).
    
    === FEATURE 1 surface (verified) ===
    - @cq/config: parseToml(source)->RawToml{aliases,reviewers,planners} in toml.ts; parseConfig/resolveReviewers/resolvePlanners/loadConfig in config.ts; CqConfig/ReviewerToken in types.ts; barrel index.ts re-exports. loadConfig(repoRoot) reads <root>/cq.toml, returns null if absent, eagerly resolves reviewers+planners. Library swap: replace parseToml internals; add a typed `webui?: {host?:string; port?:number}` to RawToml + CqConfig + parseConfig (validate host is string, port is integer 1..65535 at the boundary). loadConfig path unchanged.
    - ledger-web serve.ts: ServeOpts{host,port,mcpUrl,cwd,outdir}; parseArgs handles --host(127.0.0.1)/--port(5180)/--mcp-url/--cwd; root --cwd>$LEDGER_ROOT>cwd. serve() dispatches serveEmbedded (mcpUrl null) | serveProxy. BOTH call Bun.serve({hostname,port,...}) which THROWS on EADDRINUSE (no auto-increment). main() prints serving line to STDERR using server.port. ledger-web does NOT read cq.toml today. WIRING: in parseArgs/main, loadConfig(resolvedCwd); resolve effective host/port per-field (CLI flag tracked as 'explicitly set' vs default); add a port-scan helper that retries Bun.serve on EADDRINUSE up to N from the resolved port; print actual `http://<host>:<port>/` to STDOUT; keep stderr line. The scan must wrap the actual bind (serveEmbedded/serveProxy both take opts.port) — retry by catching the listen error and incrementing opts.port.
    
    === FEATURE 2 surface (verified) ===
    - NO `cq` bin today. FsLedgerStore.init() (packages/ledger/src/store/FsLedgerStore.ts) idempotently bootstraps docs/ledgers.yaml + canonical ledgers when absent; FsLedgerStore.reset() backs up docs/*.md+ledgers.yaml to docs/.backup/<ts>/ then reinits empty, returns ResetSummary{backupDir,ledgers[]}. NO erase impl exists.
    - Reset CLI wrapper lives ENTIRELY in ledger-mcp/src/main.ts: ParsedArgs.reset/.yes (parseArgs L120-126,L154), ResetIo/ResetOutcome interfaces (L410-429), defaultResetIo (L431-448), runReset (L463-500), main() short-circuit (L508-511). All move to cq-cli; ledger-mcp parseArgs/ParsedArgs/main lose reset/yes. Header comment L91-95 (the --reset doc) + tests referencing runReset/parseArgs reset must move/adjust.
    - flake.nix: ledgerMcp derivation is the template for a new `cq` derivation (cp packages/ledger + packages/cq-cli, symlink @cq/ledger + runtime deps, makeWrapper bun run .../cq-cli/src/main.ts). Add packages.cq + apps.cq. node-modules FOD: add packages/cq-cli/package.json to the manifest fileset (L56-62) + the cq-cli node_modules copy (L99-107). FOD-hash refresh required (52 A's -> nix build .#node-modules -> paste got:). embedServerClosure unaffected (cq is a separate bin, not embedded).
    
    === COORDINATION (Q111) ===
    G18 (goal, status planned) work milestones = M61, M62 (G18.fields.milestones). G20 W1 (parser edits) dependsOn those. G20 W2 (cq CLI) is INDEPENDENT of the parser and may proceed in parallel, EXCEPT the reset-relocation touches ledger-mcp/main.ts (not a G18 file) so no conflict. NOTE: on-disk toml.ts/types.ts already contain `planners` scaffolding locally, but G18 is not yet merged — treat G18's milestones as the gate per the user's explicit Q111 answer.

- title: Fix D31 — modal backdrop must only dismiss on a press that STARTED on the backdrop
- description: |
    Defect-seeded goal (D31, confirmed root cause H24 — clarification skipped per K8 pt4). CONFIRMED ROOT CAUSE (verbatim from D31.rootCause): the @cq/ledger-web modal backdrop closes on ANY click whose common-ancestor is the backdrop, with NO guard that the press STARTED there. The batch overlay `<div className="lw-help-backdrop" data-testid="batch-overlay" onClick={onClose}>` (App.tsx) closes via onClose=setBatchOpen(false). Because the 'save & mark answered' HoldButton fires onConfirm on a HOLD_MS TIMER (not pointerup), batchSave advances to the next (shorter) question and the content-driven `.lw-batch` (no fixed height; backdrop is a centering flexbox) shrinks WHILE the user still presses; the still-held pointer ends over the backdrop; the release synthesizes a click with common-ancestor=backdrop → onClose → premature mid-queue dismiss (react-modal #466 class). The suite was green because batchModalClose.test.tsx never simulates a backdrop click (holdFull dispatches only pointerdown + clock advance) — vacuous coverage (cf. D24/H14). The SAME `onClick={onClose}` backdrop pattern is in HelpOverlay (~App.tsx:1485) and the log modal (~3021).
    
    SUGGESTED FIX (verbatim from D31.suggestedFix): gate backdrop dismissal on the press having STARTED on the backdrop — track onMouseDown/onPointerDown (target===currentTarget) on the backdrop and only call onClose() when BOTH the down-target AND the up/click target are the backdrop. Extract a small SHARED safe-backdrop wrapper/hook and apply to ALL THREE overlays (batch + help + log) so the whole class is fixed. REPRODUCE-FIRST (happy-dom): open the batch modal, dispatch pointerdown INSIDE the dialog (on the submit/hold button) then a `click` on data-testid="batch-overlay", assert the modal STAYS OPEN — FAILS today (modal closes). Keep the existing queue-drain close test green AND keep a genuine backdrop click (down+up both on backdrop) closing the modal. Escape-to-close unchanged. Gate: bun run check.
    
    Linked defect: D31. Expected a small fix-task set (shared backdrop guard + apply to 3 overlays + reproduce-first test). NOTE coordination: App.tsx is also touched by an in-flight uncommitted comment-cleanup in the working tree — the fix worker branches off committed main so it sees the committed App.tsx; flag a possible later merge reconciliation.

- title: "Web sidebar reorder + help-popup fixed size + SVG left-align + cq: command renames"
- description: |
    Four more requests before the large project (all greenfield; the user asked to AVOID obvious questions — only ask if input is truly required):
    
    1) REORGANIZE the @cq/ledger-web left sidebar order again, with section splitters, to exactly this grouping (top→bottom):
       - questions, Q&A  — splitter
       - Goals, milestones  — splitter
       - defects, tasks  — splitter
       - handoffs  — splitter
       - decisions, hypothesis, reviews  — (optional splitter)
       - any custom ledgers
    
    2) The HELP popup resizes/jumps when the user switches between its tabs (inconvenient). Give it a LARGE CONSTANT size so it does not change size across tab switches.
    
    3) The state-machine diagrams render with inconsistent horizontal alignment (some left, some centered, some right). The alignment is INSIDE the SVG (not the HTML container). ALIGN THEM ALL TO THE LEFT if feasible.
    
    4) Improve command NAMING: everything under a `cq:` prefix. The top-level sequencer /advance → `cq:advance`. Convenient renames of the entry/bootstrap commands: plan:start → `cq:plan`, investigate:start → `cq:investigate`. The per-flow `*:advance` and `*:follow-up` commands REMAIN AS-IS (plan:advance, implement:advance, investigate:advance, plan:follow-up keep their names). (The /cq:* namespace already exists: cq:reviewers, cq:planners, cq:plan-review, cq:implement-review.)
- grounding: |
    Grounded all four parts read-only (no genuine ambiguity → skipped clarification, per user's avoid-obvious-questions instruction).
    
    PART 1 — sidebar (packages/ledger-web/src/App.tsx ~L785-1099, styles.css L261-337). Order is HARDCODED in two `visualLedgers.map` blocks, NOT derived from CANONICAL_LEDGERS: block A renders only the `questions` ledger then a `Q&A` button (`.lw-batch-open`, testid `batch-open`) + `<hr class=lw-sidebar-divider>`; block B renders all-other ledgers in their original enumerate order. `visualLedgers` (useMemo) = [questions, ...rest]. `Q&A` is NOT a ledger/pseudo-view — it is the batch-answer modal trigger button (openBatch fetches the `questions` ledger). The `ledgerCursor` keyboard nav indexes `visualLedgers` so cursor index MUST equal visual position — any reorder must rebuild `visualLedgers` to the new order AND keep cursor index aligned. Canonical ledgers (9): questions, goals, milestones, defects, tasks, hypothesis, decisions, reviews, handoffs; plus custom. Requested groups map 1:1 to these ids; the Q&A button stays grouped with `questions`. No ledger dropped. Fix = replace the two ad-hoc blocks with a GROUP-ORDERED array [['questions'(+Q&A btn)],['goals','milestones'],['defects','tasks'],['handoffs'],['decisions','hypothesis','reviews'],[<custom = any ledger not in the above]] with `<hr>` splitters between groups, preserving cursor-index==visual-position.
    
    PART 2 — help popup size (App.tsx HelpOverlay ~L1453-1546; .lw-help styles.css L161-169). `.lw-help` has min-width:440px; max-width:90vw but NO fixed height → content-driven, jumps between the 'Keyboard shortcuts' tab (a `<dl class=lw-help-list>`, no scroll) and 'State machines' tab (`.lw-help-statemachines` already max-height:70vh; overflow-y:auto). Tab switch via `setTab` swaps body content. Fix = give `.lw-help` a LARGE CONSTANT width+height (e.g. width:min(900px,90vw); height:min(80vh,720px)) with the BODY region scrolling internally (move overflow to a body wrapper so both tabs share one fixed box). CSS-only in styles.css (plus possibly a body wrapper div in HelpOverlay).
    
    PART 3 — SVG state-machine left-align (App.tsx StateMachineDiagram ~L1555-1603; stateMachine.ts; dagLayout.ts; .lw-statemachine-svg styles.css L227-233). Diagrams are GENERATED, not hand-authored: `computeStateMachine(schema)` → `computeDagLayout(statuses, transitionEdges, STATE_LAYOUT_OPTS)` lays nodes left→right by longest-path layering; each `<svg width={model.width} viewBox='0 0 W H'>`. `model.width` DIFFERS per ledger (more transition layers → wider svg). `.lw-statemachine-svg{display:block;max-width:100%}` — block is left-aligned, but `max-width:100%` scales DOWN any svg wider than the dialog, and a narrow svg keeps its small intrinsic width (left). The inconsistent left/center/right appearance comes from per-svg differing intrinsic width + scaling, NOT from HTML container alignment. Fix is INSIDE the svg/its sizing: normalise so every diagram presents left-aligned consistently — e.g. set svg width:100% with preserveAspectRatio='xMinYMid meet' (xMin = left-align content within the viewBox), or render each at a uniform width so the left edge (x=pad) lines up. Confirm via the help-statemachine-svg-<ledger> testids. No HTML wrapper change required beyond svg attrs/CSS.
    
    PART 4 — cq: command renames (cq-assets commands/, scripts/link-prompts.ts, nix/hm/dev-llm.nix, assets.nix). Command name derives from path: commands/<ns>/<name>.md → /<ns>:<name>; top-level commands/advance.md → /advance. Renames: commands/advance.md → commands/cq/advance.md (/cq:advance); commands/plan/start.md → commands/cq/plan.md (/cq:plan); commands/investigate/start.md → commands/cq/investigate.md (/cq:investigate). The *:advance and *:follow-up files STAY (plan/advance, implement/advance, investigate/advance, plan/follow-up unchanged). Existing /cq:* namespace already has commands/cq/{plan-review,implement-review,reviewers}.md (+ planners). RIPPLE: (a) scripts/link-prompts.ts LINKS array has 3 entries to update: '.claude/commands/plan/start.md'→'.claude/commands/cq/plan.md' (source ../cq-assets/commands/cq/plan.md), '.claude/commands/investigate/start.md'→'.claude/commands/cq/investigate.md', '.claude/commands/advance.md'→'.claude/commands/cq/advance.md'. (b) INTERNAL cross-refs in command/agent bodies to the renamed-FROM names: '/advance', '/plan:start', '/investigate:start' — grep cq-assets and update each occurrence to /cq:advance, /cq:plan, /cq:investigate. NOTE the staying names (/plan:advance, /implement:advance, /investigate:advance, /plan:follow-up) must NOT be touched — careful not to rename '/plan:advance' when fixing '/plan:start'. advance.md body references mostly the STAYING names; its prose 're-run /advance' references itself → becomes 're-run /cq:advance'. (c) dev-llm.nix mergedCommands fan-out is FULLY KEY-DRIVEN and directory-agnostic: assets.nix `collectMd` derives keys from the directory tree (commands/cq/advance.md → key 'cq/advance' → /cq:advance), Claude uses native `commands=mergedCommands`, Codex/Pi use `commandKeyToStem('/'→':')`. So MOVING the files is sufficient; NO edit to assets.nix or dev-llm.nix needed (the commandKeyToStem collision assertion stays satisfied: cq/advance, cq/plan, cq/investigate are distinct from existing cq/* keys). (d) cq-assets README — update any command-name listing. (e) handoff/flow prose ('re-run /advance' etc.) across cq-assets and any skill assets.
    
    DECISION (recorded, not asked): OLD names REMOVED OUTRIGHT (no deprecated aliases) — the user said 'renames' which means rename, and asked to avoid obvious questions; aliasing was not requested.
    
    SERIALIZATION (R137/R138/R139 same-file precedent): parts 1+2+3 all edit App.tsx + styles.css → MUST serialize via dependsOn. Part 4 has many cq-assets file edits + the single link-prompts.ts writer → serialize link-prompts.ts and any shared file.

- title: Describe all flow state machines + add a Flows help tab
- description: |
    Build a description of the state machines of all the flows we have (the coding-agent harness flows — plan, investigate, implement, and the top-level advance sequencer), INCLUDING transitions. The orchestrator session has states such as waiting-for-user-input; input causes a transition into one of several states; the flow loops; at some point it performs a handoff and returns back to an original/parent state.
    
    Two phases, in order:
    1) First, write a DOCUMENT describing these state machines (states + transitions for each flow).
    2) Then, add a 3rd tab, "Flows", into the web help dialog (currently: Shortcuts + State machines) that RENDERS these state machines as diagrams.
    
    Context: the help dialog already has a "State machines" tab that renders per-LEDGER status state machines (status nodes + schema.transitions edges) via computeStateMachine/computeDagLayout. The NEW "Flows" tab is different: it renders the FLOW orchestration state machines (the advance/plan/investigate/implement control loops and their handoffs), not per-ledger status diagrams.
    
    User preference: avoid obvious questions; only ask if the user's input is truly required.

    Repo grounding for G23 (web help-dialog flow diagrams + library migration):
    
    - WEB PKG: nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/packages/ledger-web; React 19.2 + react-dom 19.2, react-markdown/remark-gfm/rehype-sanitize; bundled at startup by Bun.build (serve.ts). deps in packages/ledger-web/package.json.
    - HELP DIALOG: App.tsx HelpOverlay (lines ~1485-1580). Currently TWO tabs: state `tab: 'shortcuts'|'statemachines'`, tablist buttons (data-testid help-tab-shortcuts / help-tab-statemachines). State-machines tab lazily fetches every ledger's schema (one batched enumerateLedgers+fetchLedger) and renders one StateMachineDiagram per ledger.
    - HOMEGROWN RENDERER: src/stateMachine.ts computeStateMachine(schema) -> StateMachineModel{nodes,edges,width,height,edgeless}. It delegates LAYOUT to src/dagLayout.ts computeDagLayout(ids,edges,opts) (left->right layered, straight/bezier edges, NO edge labels, DROPS self-loops). The SVG is StateMachineDiagram in App.tsx (inline <svg>, BUCKET_HEX fills from status.ts). dagLayout.computeDagLayout is ALSO used by DagView.tsx (milestone dependency DAG) and DEFAULT_LAYOUT_OPTS. Migration scope per Q116 = the two DIAGRAM TABS (State machines + new Flows); DagView/milestone-DAG is a separate concern and out of this goal's scope.
    - TEST ENV: happy-dom (CLAUDE.md) — NO layout engine, no getBBox, no ResizeObserver, no DOMMatrix. Existing state-machine tab tests assert SVG/DOM STRUCTURE (data-testid help-sm-node/edge/rect-<ledger>-<status>) because the homegrown layout is pure JS. This is the load-bearing constraint for library choice.
    - NIX: flake.nix bunNodeModules FOD (outputHash line ~117) + per-product symlink loops. The ledger-web browser-dep symlink loop is flake.nix line ~345 `for dep in react react-dom react-markdown remark-gfm rehype-sanitize bun-types`. A NEW runtime dep must be (a) added to packages/ledger-web/package.json, (b) bun.lock refreshed, (c) FOD outputHash refreshed (52 A's -> nix build .#node-modules -> paste got:), (d) added to that symlink `for dep` list so Bun.build can resolve it from the Nix closure.
    - FLOW SPEC SOURCES (phase-1 doc): the flow control loops live as prose in nix/pkg/cq-assets/commands/cq/ (plan/*, investigate/*, implement/*, advance) + the plan-advance/plan-reviewer agent prompts. Phase-1 doc derives flow states+transitions+handoffs from these. Q114: doc is a SINGLE PROSE markdown file under nix/pkg/cq-assets/docs/ (or ./docs/), kept SEPARATE from the tab's render data (no single source of truth required).
    - chromium resolvable from nixpkgs (nix eval --raw nixpkgs#chromium.outPath) for any headless ground-truth check (used for D33 this session).
    
    LIBRARY-CHOICE EVIDENCE (Q116, choice delegated to me): happy-dom (no real layout) eliminates libs whose layout needs live DOM measurement — mermaid (getBBox returns 0 outside real render tree), React Flow/@xyflow (needs container width/height + ResizeObserver/DOMMatrix mocks, large interactive-canvas bundle), cytoscape (DOM measurement). elkjs is a PURE layout engine: computes node/edge/LABEL/self-loop coords as plain data in Node/Bun with zero DOM, so the existing thin-SVG render + structural happy-dom tests are preserved while gaining edge labels + self-loops + layered routing that homegrown computeDagLayout lacks. PROPOSAL: adopt elkjs as the layout engine for BOTH diagram tabs, keep a thin in-repo SVG renderer, retire computeStateMachine's dependence on computeDagLayout. Recorded as a planning decision for adversarial review.

- title: Fix D33 — left-align cyclic state-machine diagrams (computeDagLayout layer re-base)
- description: |
    DEFECT-SEEDED goal (skips clarification; links defects:D33). Confirmed, browser-verified root cause (see defects:D33 + hypothesis:H25):
    
    computeDagLayout (nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/packages/ledger-web/src/dagLayout.ts) longest-path layering assigns a minimum layer > 0 for fully-cyclic graphs with no true source node (the milestones/tasks/goals lifecycles — every status has an incoming transition). E.g. milestones layers to blocked=1/postponed=2/open=3/done=4 with NO node on layer 0. Since x = pad + layer*(nodeWidth+hGap), the leftmost node sits at pad+176=192, leaving an empty leading column; preserveAspectRatio=xMinYMid renders that empty padding as a left gap so the content appears right-shifted. minNodeX: milestones/tasks/goals=192 (gap), all others=16 (flush) — exact match to the user census. CSS was never the cause (both prior attempts 47e8ff7 + 441d46c failed).
    
    SUGGESTED FIX (generic): in computeDagLayout, after computing all layers, re-base so the minimum layer is 0 — minLayer = Math.min(...layer.values()) (guard empty nodeIds), subtract from every node's layer before grouping/positioning. Correct for BOTH the help State-machines view AND the milestone dependency-graph DagView (a layered DAG must not reserve empty leading columns). The 441d46c CSS stays (prevents wide-diagram overflow); this layout fix is independent.
    
    ACCEPTANCE: (1) a pure unit test (no happy-dom) asserting computeDagLayout AND computeStateMachine over the milestones/tasks/goals schemas yield min node x === pad (16); existing flush-left ledgers unchanged. (2) bun run check green. (3) diagram widths shrink by the removed empty columns (regression-check the width formula). Verification artifact: re-render via headless chromium (chromium resolvable from nixpkgs) confirming all diagrams flush-left.
- sourceRefs: ["defects:D33"]
- grounding: "Confirmed against source. dagLayout.ts:120 sets x = opts.pad + l*(nodeWidth+hGap) with NO layer re-base; longest-path layering (layerOf, L87-98) can leave the minimum layer > 0 for fully-cyclic transition graphs (no source node), so every node shifts right by minLayer columns and width (L142) over-counts. stateMachine.ts:54-60 STATE_LAYOUT_OPTS.pad = 16 (matches the expected min-x for the help State-machines view); DEFAULT_LAYOUT_OPTS.pad = 24 (DagView). computeStateMachine (L78-113) delegates positioning entirely to computeDagLayout, so the single re-base fix in computeDagLayout corrects BOTH the help State-machines view and the milestone DagView. Fix: after layerOf loop (L98), compute minLayer = Math.min(...layer.values()) guarding empty nodeIds, then subtract minLayer from every layer value before the byLayer grouping/positioning at L101 onward. maxLayer/width then naturally shrink. 441d46c CSS is orthogonal (wide-diagram overflow guard) and stays."

- title: Retire legacy skills (research-loop, vsm-loop, vsm-node, question-batch) + clean up cq references
- description: |
    Retire the following four skills: research-loop, vsm-loop, vsm-node, question-batch. For future reference, MOVE them into ./docs/legacy-skills (do not delete outright). Our cq flow references these skills; we should clean up those references.
    
    User request (verbatim): "I think we should retire the following skills: research-loop, vsm-loop, vsm-node, question-batch. For future reference, move them into ./docs/legacy-skills ; our cq flow references these skills, we should cleanup the references"
    
    Scope notes for the planner to clarify: (1) where these skills currently live (likely nix/pkg/cq-assets/skills/ or similar) and what 'move to ./docs/legacy-skills' means for the build/packaging (Nix) that ships them; (2) which cq flow assets reference them (commands/cq/*, agents/*, skill manifests) and what 'clean up references' should do — remove the references, or repoint them; (3) whether retiring implies they must no longer be installed/registered as invocable skills.
