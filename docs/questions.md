- session: ae90ac43-977e-46cc-89a7-1814996d3f61
- question: "D43 fix approach (flow-governance change you wanted to steer): which design for each part? (1) STALE-WORKTREE-BASE root cause — (a) orchestrator creates MANUAL worktrees from the current main HEAD (git worktree add <path> -b impl-<T> <mainSha>) and passes that path to the worker, OR (b) keep native isolation:worktree but the implement-worker prompt FORBIDS any git op against the main checkout / other worktrees and the worker resets ONLY within its own worktree (this run's ad-hoc mitigation, which worked)? (2) COMMIT DISCIPLINE — thread 'commit ledger after planning-lock + after EVERY task merge-back' permanently into advance.md + implement/advance.md + plan/advance.md (overriding the chained-suppression for these checkpoints)? (3) Do you want to drive these cq-assets prompt edits yourself, or have me plan+implement the full D43 suggestedFix autonomously via a normal /cq:advance cycle?"
- context: "D43 (major, open) is the data-loss defect: an implement-worker under native isolation:worktree ran `git reset --hard`/checkout/cherry-pick in the MAIN checkout (not just its worktree), discarding the run's uncommitted ledger writes (recovered via replay, commit 343ef67-era; the loss was only recoverable because the reverted counters reproduced identical IDs). Root cause is CONFIRMED by inspection (reflog + prompt analysis) and documented in D43 with a 3-part suggestedFix. The LOAD-BEARING part (commit-after-merge) was ADOPTED ad-hoc THIS run (committed the ledger after every merge-back; D43 never recurred). Remaining: (b)/the prompt edits forbidding cross-checkout worker git ops + the stale-base fix. Because these edits change the flow's OWN governance and you signalled you want to steer the flow-fix, this is surfaced for your direction rather than auto-implemented mid-run. This question is HOW-to-fix (design/ownership), not whether-to-fix (D43's default disposition is FIX)."
- suggestions: ["(1b)+(2 yes)+(3 autonomous): keep native worktrees but harden the implement-worker prompt to forbid main-checkout git ops + worker-confined reset; permanently thread commit-after-planning/after-merge; let me plan+implement via /cq:advance","(1a)+(2 yes)+(3 autonomous): switch to orchestrator-managed manual worktrees; thread the commit discipline; autonomous implement","(3 steer): you take the cq-assets prompt edits yourself (I've adopted commit-after-merge already this run); leave D43 open for your manual fix"]
- recommendation: (1b) + (2 yes) + (3 autonomous). (1b) is the minimal, proven mitigation (it worked flawlessly across the 12 worker dispatches after the incident) and avoids the orchestrator-managed-worktree complexity; (2) makes the durable-ledger guarantee structural; (3) autonomous keeps momentum — but defer to you on ownership since it edits the flow's own prompts.

- author: "opus-4.8[1m]"
- session: $CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID
- question: "[1a worktree cleanup] WHO removes a Claude worker's worktree after a successful merge-back, and HOW is a locked/changed worktree handled? Native Agent isolation:worktree auto-cleans only UNCHANGED worktrees; a worker that committed its task is CHANGED, so it is never auto-removed — the accumulation source. Should the implement/advance.md §7.3 orchestrator explicitly `git worktree remove --force` (+ `git branch -D implement/<taskId>` + `git worktree prune`) the worktree right after the per-task `done` write, symmetric with the Codex path that already does this?"
- context: "implement/advance.md §7.3 currently says 'remove the worktree (Claude: auto; Codex: git worktree remove + delete the branch)'. The Claude 'auto' is the native isolation:worktree mechanism, which per §K4 (L47-55) only auto-removes UNCHANGED worktrees — so a committed task's worktree persists (the ~140 stale locked worktrees observed). The blocked-task path (§5) deliberately keeps the worktree INTACT until the user answers. Fix is prompt-only (no code)."
- suggestions: ["Orchestrator explicitly removes the changed worktree + branch after the per-task done write in §7.3 (git worktree remove --force; git branch -D; git worktree prune); blocked-task worktrees (§5) stay intact until resumed/abandoned","Only force-prune lingering locked worktrees in a periodic/start-of-pass sweep, leaving per-merge removal to the native mechanism","Both: per-merge explicit removal (primary) PLUS a start-of-pass sweep that prunes any orphaned/locked worktrees from prior crashed runs"]
- recommendation: "Both (suggestion 3): make §7.3 explicitly `git worktree remove --force <wt> && git branch -D implement/<taskId> && git worktree prune` immediately after the per-task done write (the worktree is no longer needed once the SHA is merged), AND add a start-of-pass sweep that prunes orphaned/locked worktrees left by prior interrupted runs. Leave §5 blocked-task worktrees intact. This is prompt-only and directly stops the accumulation."

- author: "opus-4.8[1m]"
- session: $CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID
- question: "[1b ~/.cache backup] What is the backup GRANULARITY/FORMAT and WHEN is it written? Options: (A) mirror the docs/*.md tree (whole-tree copy of the active ledger files + archive) on every write; (B) an append-only journal of each mutation (create/update/archive op + payload) that a restore CLI replays; (C) both — a current-state mirror plus a journal. And is it written synchronously inside each write, or via the existing post-write onMutation hook (fired after lockfile release, must-not-block, swallows throws)?"
- context: FsLedgerStore funnels every write through writeLedgerFile()->atomicWrite() and exposes an onMutation(ledgerId, op) hook fired AFTER lockfile release for create/update/archive. The goal text says 'mirror every ledger write ... restorable WITHOUT replaying MCP writes' — which favors a current-state file mirror (A) over a replay journal (B), but explicitly lists both as options. The hook is the natural async trigger; a fully-synchronous-in-write mirror would add latency/fsync to every op.
- suggestions: ["(A) Whole-tree mirror of docs/*.md (+ docs/archive) into the ~/.cache dir on every onMutation, so the cache always holds the latest restorable snapshot (no replay needed); simplest restore = copy back","(B) Append-only journal of mutations the restore CLI replays into a fresh docs/ (smaller writes, but restore = replay, which the goal says to AVOID)","(C) Both — latest-state mirror for trivial restore PLUS a journal for point-in-time/audit","Mirror only the file(s) actually changed by each op (not the whole tree) on each onMutation, for lower write cost"]
- recommendation: "(A) restated as suggestion 4: on each onMutation, mirror the file(s) the op touched (the changed docs/<ledger>.md, plus the archive file + ledgers.yaml on archive) into the ~/.cache dir via the same atomic-write primitive, off the post-lock hook so it never blocks the write path. The cache then always holds the latest restorable copy and restore is a plain copy-back — matching 'restore WITHOUT replay'. Skip a journal unless point-in-time recovery is explicitly wanted."

- question: "[1b ~/.cache backup] Confirm the PATH SCHEME, PRUNING/ROTATION, and RESTORE entrypoint. (a) Path: ~/.cache/cq/ledgers/${basename(rootDir)}-${hash(absolute rootDir)}/ — which hash (sha256-hex truncated to N chars? which N?) and respect $XDG_CACHE_HOME with ~/.cache fallback? (b) Rotation: keep only the latest mirror (overwrite in place), or retain a bounded ring of timestamped snapshots (how many)? (c) Restore: a new subcommand on the ledger-mcp CLI (e.g. `ledger-mcp restore --from-cache [--cwd <root>]`) that copies the cache mirror back into docs/, symmetric with how reset() works today?"
- context: "The goal specifies ~/.cache/cq/ledgers/${dir-name}-${absolute-path-hash}/content. The hash keyed on the absolute root path disambiguates two checkouts with the same basename. Today the only operator entrypoint is FsLedgerStore.reset() (in-repo backup); there is no restore CLI. ledger-mcp is the package that owns the store and could host a restore subcommand. XDG_CACHE_HOME is the standard base-dir var on Linux."
- suggestions: ["Path: ${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/cq/ledgers/${basename}-${sha256(absRoot) first 12 hex}/ ; Rotation: overwrite-in-place single latest mirror (the cache is a safety copy, not history) ; Restore: new `ledger-mcp restore --from-cache [--cwd]` subcommand copying cache->docs/","Same path; Rotation: keep a bounded ring of the last N timestamped snapshots (e.g. N=10) for point-in-time recovery","Restore is documented as a manual `cp -r` copy-back (no new CLI subcommand) to keep scope minimal"]
- recommendation: "Suggestion 1: ${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/cq/ledgers/${basename}-${sha256(absoluteRoot).slice(0,12)}/; overwrite-in-place single latest mirror (the cache backstops a wipe, not version history — keep it dead simple); and add a `ledger-mcp restore --from-cache [--cwd <root>]` subcommand that atomically copies the cache mirror back into docs/ (symmetric with reset()). Use a ring of timestamped snapshots only if you want point-in-time recovery (suggestion 2)."

- session: $CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID
- question: "[2 Flows tab] What is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for the role→actions mapping, and the VISUAL FORM? The current Flows tab (G23/T204-T205) renders FLOW STATE diagrams from a hand-authored TS flow-data module via the elk DiagramSvg renderer; you want per-role ACTIONS instead (orchestrator dispatches planner, planner emits candidate plan, reviewer returns verdict, orchestrator merges by SHA). (a) Source: a NEW hand-authored role→actions catalogue (TS data module), or mechanically derived from the cq-assets agent/command prompt Catalogue blocks? (b) Visual form: per-role action LISTS (text), or a role-interaction/sequence diagram (who-calls-whom edges) rendered via the existing elk DiagramSvg? (c) Does this REPLACE the current state diagrams in the Flows tab, or ADD a new view alongside them?"
- context: "G23 built the Flows tab in ledger-web/src/App.tsx HelpOverlay: hand-authored TS flow-data -> elk DiagramSvg (testids help-tab-flows / help-flow-<id>). Deriving actions mechanically from the cq-assets prompts is fragile (prose, not structured); a hand-authored catalogue is the established pattern (Q114 chose hand-authored flow data for exactly this reason). The agent/command Catalogue yaml blocks (inputs/outputs/ioSchema) are the closest structured source if derivation is wanted."
- suggestions: ["Hand-authored role→actions catalogue (new TS data module, same pattern as the existing flow-data); REPLACE the abstract state diagrams in the Flows tab with per-role action views","Hand-authored catalogue, but ADD the role-actions view alongside the existing state diagrams (toggle or stacked) rather than replacing them","Mechanically derive role→actions from the cq-assets agent/command Catalogue blocks (single source of truth, but requires a parser and is prose-fragile)","Visual form = a role-INTERACTION/sequence diagram (role nodes, labeled action edges 'dispatches planner'/'returns verdict'/'merges by SHA') via the existing elk DiagramSvg, per flow"]
- recommendation: "Hand-authored role→actions catalogue (suggestion 1 for source: new TS data module, mirroring the existing hand-authored flow-data and Q114's rationale that prose prompts are not a reliable structured source), REPLACING the abstract state diagrams in the Flows tab. For visual form, suggestion 4: a per-flow role-interaction diagram (role nodes + labeled action edges) via the existing elk DiagramSvg, which reuses the tested renderer. Confirm replace-vs-add and list-vs-diagram."

- question: "[2 Flows tab] Is the per-role-actions Flows view WEB-ONLY, or must the TUI also gain it? The tabbed help dialog (Shortcuts / Item-States / Flows) exists ONLY in ledger-web; the TUI (ledger-tui/src/app.tsx) has no help overlay, tabs, or SVG/elk renderer at all. Adding an equivalent role-actions view to the TUI is a separate, substantial build (a new help-popup mechanism + a text rendering of the catalogue)."
- context: "Q145 (G34, answered 'web frontend only') already settled this exact web-only-vs-TUI scope question for the prior Flows/Item-States help-dialog work: the tabbed help dialog has only ever existed in the web UI. This item is a continuation of that same Flows tab. The goal text for item 2 says 'ledger-web help popup; possibly TUI too', leaving it open."
- suggestions: ["Web only — consistent with Q145; modify the existing ledger-web Flows tab, leave the TUI unchanged","Both — also add a role-actions help view to the TUI (new help-popup + text catalogue rendering; significantly larger scope)"]
- recommendation: Web only (suggestion 1). The Flows tab is a web help-dialog feature; Q145 already scoped the analogous help-dialog work to ledger-web for the same reason (the TUI has no help-popup or diagram renderer). Building a parallel TUI help view is a disproportionate separate effort not implied by the core ask.

But the desired behavior is already fully specified and the root cause is already located (see context), so a separate investigate round would add little."
- context: "The behavior is pinned to ledger-tui/src/app.tsx useInput, LIST-focus branch (L840-845): key.pageUp/pageDown there scroll the CONTENT/detail pane (top.scroll, CONTENT_PAGE=10) WITHOUT switching focus — an INTENTIONAL prior affordance (comment L836-839). Home/End are not handled anywhere. So this is a known-locus behavior CHANGE with a clear spec, not an unknown fault needing investigation."
- suggestions: ["Keep it under G38 as a fix-task work-milestone (root cause + spec already known; skip a separate investigate round)","File a standalone defect linked to G38 and route it through /cq:investigate per the cq fault convention (reproduce -> root-cause -> defect-seeded fix)","File a defect record for traceability AND plan the fix task under G38 now (defect documents the fault; fix task executes it), without a separate investigate round"]
- recommendation: "Suggestion 3: file a defects record (so the fault is traceable, severity low/medium) linked to G38, AND plan the fix task(s) under a G38 work-milestone with the fix task ledgerRef'ing that defect — the defect-aware-planning pattern. The root cause is already located and the spec is unambiguous, so a separate /cq:investigate round is unnecessary; the defect record gives traceability without it."

- question: "[3 TUI keybinding] (BEHAVIOR) Confirm the exact desired key map. The requested change REVERSES a deliberate existing affordance: today, in LIST focus, PgUp/PgDn scroll the detail pane WITHOUT requiring Enter (a documented convenience). The new spec makes LIST-focus PgUp/PgDn page the CURSOR, and content scrolling happens only AFTER Enter into the item view. Confirm: (a) in LIST focus PgUp/PgDn move the cursor by one page (listInnerH rows? CONTENT_PAGE=10?) and Home/End jump to first/last row; (b) the no-Enter detail-scroll affordance is REMOVED (you accept that to scroll content you must Enter first); (c) in CONTENT focus, Home/End jump to top/bottom of the content and PgUp/PgDn page it (today only PgUp/PgDn page content, no Home/End)."
- context: "ledger-tui/src/app.tsx: LIST-focus PgUp/PgDn currently scroll top.scroll (the detail pane) by CONTENT_PAGE=10 without switching focus (comment L836-839 calls this intentional). CONTENT-focus PgUp/PgDn page content by CONTENT_PAGE; neither focus handles Home/End. FEASIBILITY NOTE: ink's useInput `key` object does not expose dedicated home/end booleans — Home/End arrive as raw escape sequences in `input` (e.g. \\x1b[H / \\x1b[F or [1~/[4~), so the fix must match those sequences directly. Please confirm a page = one screenful (listInnerH) is acceptable, or fix at 10."
- suggestions: ["Confirm full reversal: LIST focus — PgUp/PgDn page the cursor by one screenful (listInnerH rows), Home/End jump to first/last row; the no-Enter detail-scroll affordance is removed; CONTENT focus — PgUp/PgDn page content (CONTENT_PAGE), Home/End jump to content top/bottom","Same, but page size = fixed CONTENT_PAGE (10) rows for the cursor too, not a full screenful","Keep the no-Enter detail-scroll affordance on a DIFFERENT key and give PgUp/PgDn/Home/End to the cursor (so nothing is lost)"]
- recommendation: "Suggestion 1: in LIST focus, PgUp/PgDn page the cursor by one visible screenful (listInnerH rows — more natural than a fixed 10 for list paging) and Home/End jump to first/last row; remove the no-Enter detail-scroll (Enter-then-scroll is the consistent model the spec asks for). In CONTENT focus, PgUp/PgDn page content by CONTENT_PAGE and add Home/End to jump to content top/bottom. Implement Home/End by matching the raw escape sequences in `input` since ink exposes no key.home/key.end."
