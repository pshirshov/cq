A WRITE serialises the touched ledger to text, then INSIDE the existing per-ledger AsyncMutex+lockfile critical section: read the CURRENT ref sha (expected-old), hash-object the new blob, write a tree from a scratch index containing ALL current ledger files with the one path replaced, commit-tree (orphan on first, child thereafter), then CAS updateRef(ref,new,expectedOld) — a StaleRefError surfaces the lost-update race loudly (caveat 1). Every mutation advances the ref (continuous commit history). Archive files (docs/archive/...) live as paths in the SAME orphan tree. Advisory docs/.locks/*.lock STAY on the real FS (gitignored), NEVER in the tree (caveat 2). Schema-divergence reinit: tag refs/tags/cq-ledger-backup-<ts> at the current orphan head BEFORE reinitialising the ref (Q195(1)); detection (schemasEqual) is the shared base's, unchanged.

- description: "Add a ref-sha coherence trigger for the GIT backend (Q191). Add startLedgerRefWatcher(store, root, onChange?) that watches/polls the orphan ref refs/heads/cq-ledger for sha changes on a bounded interval (reuse the existing watcher's DEBOUNCE_MS cadence) and, on a change, calls store.invalidate(<ledgerId>) per ledger then fires onChange so the HTTP host still publishes the WS `ledger.changed` frame; invalidate() in the git backend re-reads the changed ledger(s) from the new ref via the seam. IMPORTANT (R418/opus): do NOT assume the ref lives at a literal `.git/refs/heads/cq-ledger` — that breaks under git-dir indirection (a linked worktree where `.git` is a FILE, a submodule, or a $GIT_DIR/core.worktree override; K66 keeps the linked-worktree approach as the documented fallback). RESOLVE the ref's real location via `git rev-parse --git-path refs/heads/<branch>` (+ `--git-path packed-refs`) at startup, or simply poll `git rev-parse --verify refs/heads/<branch>` (git resolves loose/packed/indirection itself) — never a hard-coded `.git/...` path. Per-backend selection is owned by the construction site (T357): the FS backend keeps the existing docs/*.md startLedgerWatcher; the git backend uses THIS ref-sha watcher INSTEAD (this is the Q191 'replace the file-watch trigger' applied per-backend, not in addition). The WS onMutation/`ledger.changed` broadcast itself is backend-agnostic and UNCHANGED."
- acceptance: "A test: two GitObjectLedgerBackend instances on the same repo; a write through instance A advances the ref, and after the ref-watcher fires, instance B's reads reflect A's write (cross-process coherence) and onChange was invoked with the ledger id. The watcher resolves the ref via `git rev-parse --git-path`/`rev-parse --verify` (NOT a literal `.git/refs/...` path) — covered by a test that points the repo's git dir somewhere non-default (e.g. a linked worktree or GIT_DIR override) and confirms the watcher still detects the advance. tsc -b + lint clean."

FRESH-INIT GITIGNORE (R418/codex+grok): when `cq init` (or first backend startup) runs with backend='git-object' on a repo with NO pre-existing ledger to migrate, ensure docs/*.md + docs/ledgers.yaml are gitignored from the start (add the same clearly-marked git-backend .gitignore block that `cq move-ledger --to git` uses, idempotently — do not duplicate it if move-ledger already added it) so a fresh git-object ledger is never accidentally tracked on the working branch. Preserve buildServer's capability wiring: read_log/config/promptCatalog are gated on `store instanceof FsLedgerStore` today — generalise to a capability check so an FS-only capability (readLog, ~/.cache restore) is absent for the git backend while config/promptCatalog (root-bound, backend-independent) remain available.

- headline: "Confirm zero frontend changes: frontends refresh solely via WS ledger.changed"
- description: Per Q192, VERIFY (read-through of ledger-tui + ledger-web refresh paths) that the TUI and web frontends learn about changes ONLY via the internal WS `ledger.changed` channel (fired by onMutation, backend-agnostic) and NOT via any path that reads docs/*.md mtimes directly — which would break when docs/*.md no longer exist on the working branch under the git backend. Frontends are pure MCP clients (CLAUDE.md) even embedded; embedded-mode frontends co-host the store in-process, so they are covered by the backend's own onMutation + ref-sha coherence. If the verification holds, scope ZERO frontend code changes and record the confirmation as a `decisions` item citing the exact refresh code paths; if any path watches docs/ mtimes, file it as an out-of-scope `defects` item for the reviewer (do not fix here unless a trivial repoint).
- acceptance: A `decisions` item records the confirmation, citing the exact frontend refresh code paths showing they key on WS `ledger.changed` only (no docs/*.md-mtime dependency for change detection). If a violation is found, a `defects` item exists. No frontend source changed unless a violation required a trivial repoint. tsc -b + lint clean.

ZERO frontend source change needed for the git backend — confirmation recorded as decision K69. One out-of-scope gap surfaced + filed as D51 (low): embedded TUI main.tsx:128 hardcodes the FS startLedgerWatcher instead of the backend-selecting startLedgerCoherenceWatcher (web embedded does it right), so embedded-TUI+git-object loses EXTERNAL-change coherence (self-edits still refetch).

- description: "Add a `move-ledger` subcommand to cq-cli/src/main.ts (extend SUBCOMMANDS, parser, HANDLERS, USAGE) — a NATIVE TypeScript subcommand analogous to runInit/runReset (NOT a prompt-driven command). Per Q193 (user request) it performs LOSSLESS BIDIRECTIONAL transplant of the live ledger between the docs/ working tree and the orphan ref refs/heads/cq-ledger, via an EXPLICIT `--to git | local` direction (refuse without it). **--to git:** snapshot the current docs/*.md + docs/archive + docs/ledgers.yaml tree into the orphan ref's commit via GitPlumbing; then `git rm --cached docs/*.md`(+archive+ledgers.yaml) on the working branch and add a clearly-marked, reversible git-backend block to .gitignore (docs/*.md + docs/ledgers.yaml) so the docs ledger files stop being TRACKED, leaving pre-migration tracked history FROZEN in place for audit; set [ledger] backend='git-object' in cq.toml. WORKING-TREE FILE DISPOSITION (R418/opus): the now-untracked docs/*.md files are LEFT IN PLACE on disk (do NOT delete them) — they become untracked-but-present and are simply ignored by git; print a note that they may be removed manually once the user is confident. **--to local:** the REVERSE — materialize the orphan ref's tree back to docs/*.md on disk, re-track them (remove the git-backend .gitignore block + re-add), set backend='fs'. Refuse if the target already holds a non-empty ledger unless `--force`; print a per-ledger moved-file summary; honour the [ledger] branch name. Document the linked-worktree fallback (`git worktree add <dir> cq-ledger`) in the command help. The .gitignore edit must be reversible by the opposite direction."
- acceptance: "Round-trip test in a throwaway repo: seed docs/ ledgers, `cq move-ledger --to git` → orphan ref carries identical ledger bytes, docs ledger files UNTRACKED (`git ls-files docs/` shows none) but STILL PRESENT on disk (left-in-place), cq.toml backend=git-object; `cq move-ledger --to local` restores TRACKED docs/*.md byte-identical to the orphan-ref content + backend=fs; the round trip is provably lossless INCLUDING on-disk file state (the docs/*.md bytes before --to git equal the bytes after --to local) and tracked-state (tracked→untracked→tracked); refuses a non-empty target without --force. tsc -b + lint clean."
