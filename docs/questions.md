- author: user
- session: 994b02a0-7e3f-40df-81ed-b12b9ce6b13e
- question: "Which subagent mechanism should we adopt for Pi: (a) the third-party npm extension `nicobailon/pi-subagents`, (b) badlogic's own example subagent extension shipped in pi-mono's examples/extensions, or (c) a bespoke in-repo Pi extension (nix/pkg/pi-extensions/*.ts via pi.registerTool) purpose-built for the cq flow? Or do you want the plan to start with an evaluation/spike task that compares them and a follow-up to commit the choice?"
- context: "Pi has no native subagents (pi-context.md says so explicitly). The flow needs to dispatch explorers/reviewers/workers. nicobailon/pi-subagents is the closest off-the-shelf match: it already uses agent markdown files with YAML frontmatter (model/tools/skills), /chain + /parallel slash commands, and a 'children do not register the subagent tool' boundary that mirrors our own 'subagents-cannot-spawn-subagents' invariant. The tradeoff is third-party-dependency risk + frontmatter-shape mismatch vs. our existing `mergedAgents` definitions, versus the control (and maintenance cost) of a bespoke extension. This choice determines essentially the entire task breakdown."
- suggestions: ["Adopt nicobailon/pi-subagents (npm package), adapt our agent bundle to its frontmatter","Vendor/port badlogic's example subagent extension into nix/pkg/pi-extensions","Write a bespoke in-repo pi.registerTool extension driven by our existing mergedAgents","First task: spike/compare all three read-only, then a decision item picks one before implementation"]
- recommendation: Start with a short spike comparing nicobailon/pi-subagents against a bespoke extension, but bias toward the bespoke in-repo extension if its frontmatter/dispatch contract diverges from our mergedAgents shape — it keeps the cross-harness dispatch contract under our control and avoids a third-party dependency in the unattended worker path.

- session: 994b02a0-7e3f-40df-81ed-b12b9ce6b13e
- question: "How portable must the cq command prompts (plan/investigate/implement *:advance) be once Pi gains subagents? Should the prompts dispatch subagents through a single harness-agnostic abstraction (so the SAME prompt text works on Claude's Task tool, Codex multi_agent, and Pi), or is it acceptable for the prompts to branch on harness ('if Pi, call the pi-subagents tool; if Claude, use Task')?"
- context: The cq command prompts currently assume Claude Code's native `Task`-tool dispatch and encode rules like 'you never spawn subagents' / 'subagents cannot spawn subagents'. Codex already diverges (features.multi_agent). The portability target dictates whether this goal also requires editing the shared command prompts in nix/pkg/cq-assets, or only adds a Pi-side adapter that maps the existing dispatch convention onto Pi's mechanism. This is load-bearing for scope (touch shared prompts vs Pi-only).
- suggestions: ["Single harness-agnostic dispatch abstraction; minimize/avoid harness-specific branches in prompts","Pi-side adapter only: keep prompts as-is, the Pi mechanism interprets the existing dispatch convention","Explicit per-harness branches in the prompts are acceptable"]
- recommendation: Prefer a Pi-side adapter that interprets the EXISTING dispatch convention (the agent name + task the prompt already specifies), so the shared command prompts stay unchanged and Claude/Codex are unaffected; only fall back to prompt edits if the convention can't be expressed Pi-side.
- ledgerRefs: ["goals:G28"]
- answer: I would prefer these prompts to work unchanged in all harnesses

- author: user
- session: 994b02a0-7e3f-40df-81ed-b12b9ce6b13e
- question: Which model/provider should Pi subagents run under, and does each cq subagent role's `suggestedModel` tier (frontier/standard/fast) need to map to a concrete Pi provider+model? Pi's default is grok-build, but the cq agents carry Claude-oriented model hints.
- context: Under Claude Code each subagent inherits a Claude model; the cq agent definitions and task `suggestedModel` tiers assume that resolution. Pi can route to grok-build, openrouter, ollama-cloud, minimax, anthropic-OAuth, etc. (see programs.pi packages). A subagent extension typically lets an agent's frontmatter pin a model. We need to know whether Pi subagents should (a) all inherit the parent's active Pi model, (b) map our frontier/standard/fast tiers to specific Pi providers, or (c) be left to the chosen extension's defaults. This affects whether the plan must add a tier->Pi-model mapping.
- suggestions: ["Subagents inherit the parent Pi session's active model (simplest)","Map frontier/standard/fast tiers to specific Pi providers+models (e.g. frontier=grok-build or anthropic, fast=ollama/minimax)","Defer to the chosen extension's per-agent frontmatter defaults"]
- recommendation: Have subagents inherit the parent Pi model for the first iteration (least new config, matches how Claude subagents inherit), and defer a tier->provider mapping to a follow-up unless you already want cost/latency tiering on day one.
- ledgerRefs: ["goals:G28"]
- answer: Essentially, it orchestrator should be able to specify which agents it wants to run. Also we need specific fast-standard-frontier mapping defined in cq.toml

- author: user
- session: 994b02a0-7e3f-40df-81ed-b12b9ce6b13e
- question: "What is the acceptance/verification bar for this goal — how do we prove Pi subagents 'work correctly, mirroring Claude Code'? Specifically, which cq flow(s) must run end-to-end under Pi as the success criterion (e.g. a full /cq:plan:advance round dispatching candidate planners, or /cq:investigate:advance dispatching read-only explorers, or /cq:implement:advance dispatching workers+reviewers), and on what target repo?"
- context: Per operationalism, 'works correctly under pi' needs a concrete, observable test. The cq flow uses subagents in distinct shapes per phase (read-only explorers in investigate, candidate planners + reviewers in plan, isolated-worktree workers + reviewers in implement). Knowing the minimum demonstrable flow (and whether it must run unattended in the yolo/bubblewrap sandbox) sets each task's `acceptance` field and bounds scope.
- suggestions: ["A single phase end-to-end under Pi is sufficient acceptance (name which)","All three phases (plan/investigate/implement) must dispatch subagents successfully under Pi","Just the dispatch primitive working (spawn a child, get a structured result back) is enough; full-flow validation is a follow-up"]
- recommendation: "Make the acceptance bar: one read-only explorer dispatch (investigate-style) AND one reviewer dispatch (plan-review-style) complete under Pi and return a parseable result, demonstrated on THIS repo in the normal (non-sandboxed) environment first; full unattended-sandbox + implement-worker validation as a follow-up goal."

- author: user
- session: 994b02a0-7e3f-40df-81ed-b12b9ce6b13e
- question: If we adopt an npm-distributed extension (e.g. nicobailon/pi-subagents), is adding it to programs.pi.settings.packages (Pi's managed --legacy-peer-deps npm install on first run) acceptable, or must it be vendored/pinned into the Nix store like the codex-plugin-cc and pi-extensions are, for reproducibility on the unattended llm-worker hosts?
- context: The existing Pi packages (rpiv-web-tools, pi-anthropic-auth, pi-ollama-cloud, minimax, pi-xai) are installed from npm at first run, NOT pinned in Nix — but the comments note self-containedness constraints around Pi's loader/jiti alias map. A subagent extension that spawns child Pi sessions and reads agent markdown is more load-bearing for the flow than a provider shim, so reproducibility/pinning policy matters. This determines whether a packaging task (vendor + FOD hash, like pkg/pi-coding-agent) is in scope.
- suggestions: ["npm install via programs.pi.settings.packages is fine (matches existing providers)","Must be vendored/pinned in the Nix store for unattended-host reproducibility","Prefer a local extension (nix/pkg/pi-extensions/*.ts) precisely to avoid the npm-pinning question"]
- recommendation: If we go with a third-party extension, vendor+pin it in the Nix store (it is load-bearing for the flow on unattended hosts); if that vendoring cost is high, that is itself an argument for the bespoke local nix/pkg/pi-extensions approach from Q1.
- ledgerRefs: ["goals:G28"]
- answer: If we use a third party extension there is no need to vendor it BUT I'm biased towards custom extension - because we will need one later for a determenistic logic governing the orchestrating session

- question: "Mechanism lock-in (re Q125 counter-question): given the now-fixed constraints — Q126 the shared cq command prompts must work UNCHANGED across harnesses (Pi-side adapter only, interpreting the existing dispatch convention), Q127 the orchestrator must be able to name which agent to run and the fast/standard/frontier tiers must resolve via a cq.toml mapping to concrete Pi provider+model pairs, Q128 acceptance = one read-only explorer dispatch + one reviewer dispatch returning a parseable result on THIS repo non-sandboxed, and Q129 no Nix-vendoring requirement plus your stated bias toward a bespoke in-repo extension (also needed later for deterministic orchestration-session logic) — which subagent mechanism do we lock for Pi: (a) third-party npm `nicobailon/pi-subagents`, (b) vendor/port badlogic's example subagent extension, or (c) a bespoke in-repo `nix/pkg/pi-extensions` `pi.registerTool` extension? Full grounded pros/cons/difficulty/downsides analysis is in the context field below."
- context: |
    EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS (read-only grounding this round; opus-4.8[1m]).
    
    === What the mechanism must actually do (derived from the repo, not assumed) ===
    The cq commands already encode a PER-HARNESS dispatch split, not a single abstraction. In nix/pkg/cq-assets/commands/cq/investigate/advance.md (L42-44) and implement/advance.md the convention is literally: 'Claude -> dispatch via the Agent tool with subagent_type: "<agent-name>" (+ isolation: "worktree"); Codex -> native multi_agent + manual git worktree add/remove'. There is currently NO Pi branch. The agents are named markdown files at nix/pkg/cq-assets/agents/<name>.md (plan-advance, plan-reviewer, investigate-explorer/-prober, implement-worker/-reviewer/-conflict-resolver) carrying `name` / `description` / `disallowedTools` frontmatter; dev-llm.nix materializes them into Claude via programs.claude-code.agents (-> ~/.claude/agents/<name>.md) but does NOT project them to Pi at all (programs.pi consumes only commands as promptTemplates + skills). So under Pi, every dispatch step has no runtime mechanism. The Pi mechanism must therefore: (1) be invokable in a way the EXISTING prompt text already says (the prompt names an agent + a task + sometimes isolation:worktree), (2) read the mergedAgents markdown for that name (its description + disallowedTools), (3) spawn a child Pi session with the agent's tools filtered + a resolved model, (4) enforce subagents-cannot-spawn-subagents (the child must NOT see the dispatch tool), and (5) return a structured, parseable result to the parent (the orchestrator parses explorer evidence-json / reviewer verdict-json).
    
    === How hard is a bespoke extension, concretely? (the user's direct question) ===
    The in-repo extension API is compact and already proven. The two existing extensions are the evidence: patch-grok-build-context-window.ts (~75 lines) and drop-client-web-search-for-grok.ts (~40 lines). They show the whole surface we need: `export default function(pi: ExtensionAPI)`, `pi.on("session_start"|"before_provider_request", handler)`, `pi.registerProvider(...)`, payload inspection/mutation, and event ordering guarantees. A subagent extension additionally needs `pi.registerTool` (register one tool, e.g. dispatch_agent({agent, task})) and the ability to run a child Pi turn with a filtered toolset + chosen model. Loading is one line in programs.pi.settings.extensions (a store path), exactly like the two existing ones. Realistic size: a single TS file on the order of 150-300 lines (tool registration + read agent markdown + spawn child session with filtered tools + resolved model + return structured result), NOT a package. The hard/uncertain part is NOT the cq-side glue — it is the child-session spawning primitive: we must confirm Pi's ExtensionAPI exposes a supported way to run an isolated child agent turn (its own context, filtered tools) and capture its final output. That is the ONE thing to de-risk; badlogic's example extension and nicobailon/pi-subagents BOTH already do exactly this, which is direct proof the primitive exists in this Pi version — we would lift the spawning technique from them even if we don't depend on them.
    
    === Option (a) nicobailon/pi-subagents (npm) ===
    Pros: closest off-the-shelf fit; already does isolated child sessions, agent-markdown-with-YAML-frontmatter (model/tools/skills), /chain + /parallel slash commands, AND a 'children do not register the subagent tool' boundary that mirrors our subagents-cannot-spawn-subagents invariant. Cons measured against the fixed constraints: (i) Q126 — its dispatch surface is /chain + /parallel slash commands and its OWN frontmatter shape, which is NOT the convention our shared prompts speak (Agent tool + subagent_type + isolation:worktree). To make the prompts work unchanged we would STILL need an adapter that maps our convention onto its tool, so we don't actually avoid writing in-repo glue — we add a third-party dep ON TOP of glue. (ii) Frontmatter mismatch vs our mergedAgents (name/description/disallowedTools) means either rewriting our agents to its schema or writing a shim — friction either way. (iii) Q129 — you explicitly do NOT want to depend on it long-term and it CANNOT host the future deterministic orchestration-session logic. (iv) third-party maintenance/version risk on the load-bearing worker path. No vendoring required per Q129, but the dependency itself is the objection.
    
    === Option (b) vendor/port badlogic's example extension ===
    Pros: first-party badlogic example (isolated-context child sessions, filtered tools) — a clean, minimal reference and the most authoritative proof of the spawning primitive. Cons: it is an EXAMPLE, not a maintained package, so adopting it = porting it into nix/pkg/pi-extensions anyway (i.e. it collapses into option (c) with a head start). Same Q126 adapter work needed (it isn't built around our convention). Net: best treated as a CODE REFERENCE for option (c), not a separate adopt-able mechanism.
    
    === Option (c) bespoke in-repo pi.registerTool extension (RECOMMENDED) ===
    Pros: (i) Q126 — we own the dispatch contract, so we register a tool whose call shape matches what the shared prompts ALREADY say (agent name + task [+ isolation]); prompts stay byte-for-byte unchanged and Claude/Codex are untouched. (ii) Q127 — naturally supports orchestrator-named agents (the tool takes the agent name) and a tier->provider mapping: cq.toml already parses an [aliases] table (harness/model) via the ledger config layer; we add a [tiers] (fast/standard/frontier -> alias-or-provider+model) mapping and the extension resolves suggestedModel through it. (iii) Q129 — it is the SAME extension surface (nix/pkg/pi-extensions/*.ts, pi.registerTool/registerProvider) we will need for the future deterministic orchestration-session logic, so the investment compounds. (iv) no third-party dependency on the unattended worker path. Cons/downsides (stated honestly): we own the child-session lifecycle (spawn, tool-filtering, result capture, error handling) and its maintenance; we carry the risk if Pi's ExtensionAPI child-session surface changes across Pi bumps (mitigated: only this one extension breaks, and the two existing extensions show bumps are manageable); and we must first DE-RISK the child-session spawning primitive (a tiny spike reading badlogic's example + Pi's coding-agent extension API) before committing the task breakdown. That spike is the single genuine unknown.
    
    === RECOMMENDATION ===
    Lock option (c), the bespoke in-repo nix/pkg/pi-extensions extension, with badlogic's example used as a code reference for the child-session spawning primitive. Justification: the three fixed constraints all point the same way — Q126 (prompts unchanged) and Q127 (orchestrator-named agent + cq.toml tier mapping) are most directly satisfied by a tool WE shape to the existing convention; Q129 (no-vendor bias + future deterministic-orchestration extension) makes the in-repo extension the reusable foundation rather than a throwaway. The only real cost is owning the child-session lifecycle + one de-risking spike of the spawning primitive, which is bounded and which options (a)/(b) prove is achievable. If the spike reveals Pi's ExtensionAPI cannot spawn a filtered-tool child session at all, that single finding would reopen this choice toward (a)/(b) — so the first planned task should be that read-only spike with a go/no-go on the primitive.
- suggestions: ["(a) Adopt third-party npm nicobailon/pi-subagents (no vendoring per Q129) + an adapter mapping our dispatch convention onto its tool, and reshape agent frontmatter to its schema","(b) Vendor/port badlogic's example subagent extension into nix/pkg/pi-extensions (collapses into option c with a head start)","(c) RECOMMENDED: bespoke in-repo nix/pkg/pi-extensions pi.registerTool extension shaped to the existing dispatch convention, reading mergedAgents + resolving suggestedModel via a new cq.toml [tiers] mapping, using badlogic's example as a spawning-primitive reference"]
- recommendation: "Lock (c) the bespoke in-repo extension. It is the only option that satisfies Q126 (shared prompts unchanged — we shape the tool to the existing Agent/subagent_type convention), Q127 (orchestrator names the agent; fast/standard/frontier resolve via a new cq.toml [tiers] mapping the config layer already supports alongside [aliases]), and Q129 (no third-party worker-path dependency, and it IS the extension surface the future deterministic orchestration-session logic will reuse). Implementation difficulty is moderate and bounded: ~150-300 lines in one TS file using the same ExtensionAPI the two existing pi-extensions already use; the single real unknown is whether Pi's ExtensionAPI can spawn a filtered-tool child session and capture its result — which badlogic's example and nicobailon/pi-subagents both prove it can. The honest downside is that we own the child-session lifecycle and its maintenance across Pi version bumps. Recommend the first planned task be a read-only spike confirming that spawning primitive (go/no-go), after which the rest of the breakdown is committed."

- question: "G28's integration + acceptance tail (T224 load the dispatch extension into a running pi; T225 observe tier resolution in pi's provider logs; T229 confirm an UNCHANGED cq prompt fires the dispatch tool under pi; T226/T227 the acceptance demos — one explorer + one reviewer dispatch under the wrapped pi harness) all require the new programs.pi/dev-llm.nix wiring to be HOME-MANAGER-ACTIVATED and the wrapped `pi` harness run with live provider auth (grok-build OAuth) to load the extension and perform live LLM-backed subagent dispatch. The autonomous sandbox session cannot run `home-manager switch` or drive the live interactive pi harness, so it cannot complete/verify Q128's acceptance bar. How do you want to proceed? (a) You activate the wiring (`home-manager switch`) and run the T226/T227 acceptance demos in your environment, reporting the transcripts back; (b) confirm the sandbox CAN activate home-manager + run pi headlessly (and the agent should attempt it); or (c) the agent keeps autonomously building the env-independent remainder (T228 runtime-config-access decision, T222 agents-dir nix projection — verifiable via nix eval / git diff) and you drive only the live-pi acceptance tail. Buildable-without-pi: T228, T222. Needs activated-pi-env: T224, T225, T229, T226, T227."
- context: "Plan G28 is `planned` (locked, R268 unanimous go-ahead). Implemented + merged this run: T223 (cq.toml [tiers]+[agent_tiers] + @cq/config parser/resolvers, bun run check green 1038/0, commit 92aae54) and T221 (go/no-go spike: GO — all 5 Pi 0.78.0 ExtensionAPI primitives confirmed at exact file:line, Route A subprocess `pi -p --mode json` recommended, commit bd6aa87). M87 complete; M89 has T223 done (T228 still planned). The DAG bottleneck is the live-pi environment for the integration/acceptance milestones M88/M90/M91. This question gates how the env-dependent tasks get executed; it does NOT block the env-independent T228/T222, which the next /cq:advance can build autonomously."
- suggestions: ["You run `home-manager switch` + the T226/T227 acceptance demos in your environment and report the pi transcripts","Confirm the sandbox can activate home-manager + run pi headlessly with provider auth, and the agent attempts the full tail","Agent autonomously builds the env-independent remainder (T228, T222) on the next /cq:advance; you drive the live-pi acceptance tail (T224–T227)"]
- recommendation: "Option (c) for the next /cq:advance pass (autonomously land T228 + T222 — both verifiable without pi), then option (a) for the acceptance tail: you activate the wiring and run the two demos, since live LLM-backed subagent dispatch under the interactive pi harness is best observed in your environment with provider auth. If the sandbox can in fact `home-manager switch` + run pi headlessly (option b), say so and the agent will drive the whole tail."

- answer: You should be able to build pi package autonomously and run within your sandbox - you have nix at your disposal, you don't need to switch system in order to test a package.

- question: "Which IN-MODEL provider separator is canonical for the provider-qualified pi token — the colon you proposed (`pi:ollama-cloud:minimax-m3`), the slash already shipped in the T225 extension (`pi:ollama-cloud/minimax-m3`, which D36's suggestedFix also cites), or should both be accepted?"
- context: "GROUNDING — the harness split is NOT ambiguous: both `parseReviewerToken` (cq-config/src/config.ts L44-52) and the extension's `parseCqToken` (cq-subagent-dispatch.ts L251-258) split on the FIRST `:` and keep everything after it in `model`. So `pi:ollama-cloud:minimax-m3` ALREADY parses to `{harness:'pi', model:'ollama-cloud:minimax-m3'}` today — no collision. The real divergence is purely in PROVIDER EXTRACTION from the model segment: `tokenToChildModel` (L320-327) splits the model on `/` (not `:`) to emit `--provider`, so only the SLASH form yields a provider today; @cq/config performs NO provider extraction at all (it stores `model` opaquely). T225 already shipped+demoed the slash form (`pi:ollama-cloud/minimax-m3`). Choosing the canonical separator determines whether we add new colon-splitting logic to BOTH layers or simply add provider-extraction to @cq/config matching the slash the extension already uses."
- suggestions: ["Standardize on the slash `pi:<provider>/<model>` already shipped+demoed in T225 (extension unchanged; just teach @cq/config to extract the provider on `/`)","Adopt the colon `pi:<provider>:<model>` you proposed (requires NEW second-colon-split provider extraction in BOTH @cq/config and the extension's tokenToChildModel)","Accept BOTH separators everywhere (most permissive; both layers split on `/` OR a second `:`)"]
- recommendation: "Standardize on the slash `pi:<provider>/<model>` already shipped+demoed in T225 — it minimizes change (the extension already does this; @cq/config gains a small provider-extraction step that mirrors `tokenToChildModel`), keeps one grammar across both layers, and matches D36's suggestedFix verbatim. A second-colon scheme works mechanically but means writing and keeping-in-sync two new split paths for no functional gain over the slash."

- question: What is the in-scope surface for this change — should the @cq/config layer be extended to EXTRACT and EXPOSE the provider (a structured `provider` field on ReviewerToken, surfaced via get_reviewers/get_planners/tier resolution), or only to PARSE-and-PRESERVE the qualified token string so the dispatch extension remains the sole place that splits out `--provider`?
- context: "GROUNDING — today @cq/config's `ReviewerToken` (cq-config/src/types.ts L20-23) is `{harness, model}` with NO provider field; `model` holds the entire post-harness segment opaquely. Provider extraction lives ONLY in the extension's `tokenToChildModel`. The two layers are COPIES, not shared code (the extension is a standalone store-path file outside the bun workspace and cannot import @cq/config — see cq-subagent-dispatch.ts L49-56). So 'add provider support to the config grammar' could mean (a) add a real `provider` field + extraction to @cq/config so get_reviewers/get_planners callers see provider=ollama-cloud, or (b) only validate/pass the qualified string through @cq/config and let the extension keep being the one place provider is split off. The defect D36 is specifically about the DISPATCH path (the extension), but the goal text says it must be 'parsed by the @cq/config layer' too."
- suggestions: ["Add a structured `provider: string | null` to @cq/config's ReviewerToken + extraction in parseReviewerToken, surfaced through get_reviewers/get_planners and tier resolution; the extension keeps its own mirrored copy in sync","@cq/config only parses+preserves the qualified token (no new field); only the extension's tokenToChildModel splits provider for `--provider`","Both layers extract provider, AND record a decisions item noting the two copies must stay in sync (no shared import is possible)"]
- recommendation: Add a structured `provider` field to @cq/config (option a) AND keep the extension's mirrored copy in sync — the goal explicitly requires @cq/config to honor the grammar, get_reviewers/get_planners consumers benefit from seeing the provider, and the existing K46/T223 'mirror, don't import' discipline already governs keeping the two copies aligned.

- question: "Should the bare `pi:<model>` form (no provider) keep working unchanged (provider omitted → pi's fuzzy match, exactly today's behavior), or should it be deprecated/warned now that an explicit-provider form exists?"
- context: "GROUNDING — today a bare `pi:minimax-m3` resolves with NO `--provider` and lets pi's non-deterministic fuzzy matching pick — that IS the D36 defect. Many existing cq.toml entries (e.g. live `[aliases] grok = ...`, and the example's minimax) use the bare form and are unambiguous because their model registers under exactly one provider. Deprecating the bare form would be a breaking change to every existing config; keeping it backward-compatible means the bare form stays valid and only ambiguous models need the qualified form."
- suggestions: ["Keep the bare `pi:<model>` form fully backward-compatible (provider omitted → unchanged fuzzy behavior); only ambiguous models need the qualified form","Keep it working but emit a warning when a bare token resolves to a model registered under multiple providers","Deprecate the bare form (require explicit provider for all pi tokens) — breaking change"]
- recommendation: "Keep the bare `pi:<model>` form fully backward-compatible — it is non-breaking and the qualified form is purely additive; the bare form is only problematic for multi-provider models, which the user fixes by adding the provider. A multi-provider warning (option b) is a reasonable optional nicety but not required to resolve D36."

- question: "Should the provider-qualified form apply ONLY to `pi:` tokens, or also to `claude:` tokens?"
- context: "GROUNDING — the harnesses are exactly `claude` and `pi` (types.ts L11). The provider concept (and `--provider`) is a pi runtime feature: `tokenToChildModel` returns null for any non-`pi` harness (cq-subagent-dispatch.ts L320-321), and a `claude:` token cannot be driven by a child pi process at all. D36 is entirely about pi/minimax. So a provider-qualified `claude:<provider>/<model>` form has no consumer today and would be dead grammar."
- suggestions: ["pi: only — a provider qualifier on a claude: token is a config error (or ignored)","Accept the qualifier syntactically on both, but it is only meaningful/honored for pi:"]
- recommendation: "pi: only — the provider qualifier is meaningful exclusively for the pi harness; reject (or document-as-ignored) a provider qualifier on a claude: token rather than carrying dead grammar. This keeps the validation surface honest and matches where `--provider` is actually consumed."

- question: "What is the acceptance bar that closes D36 — is `bun test` coverage in @cq/config for the new grammar (parse + resolve through tiers/reviewers/planners) PLUS an updated cq.toml.example sufficient, or do you also require a LIVE dispatch demonstration that `minimax = \"pi:ollama-cloud/...\"` actually emits `--provider ollama-cloud` and the minimax reviewer/planner no longer abstains?"
- context: "GROUNDING — @cq/config is unit-tested via `bun test` (run from nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/). D36's live evidence in T225 already demonstrated `pi:ollama-cloud/minimax-m3` emitting the correct `--provider` via the dispatch extension's `details.childProvider`. The goal also notes the minimax reviewer/planner shellouts ABSTAINED every run because they resolved to `--provider minimax` (key-gated, $MINIMAX_API_KEY absent). Whether a fresh live minimax run is part of acceptance — or whether unit tests + the prior T225 evidence suffice — sets how big the verification tasks are. The cq.toml.example to update lives under nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/ (planner will confirm exact filename)."
- suggestions: ["bun test coverage in @cq/config (parse the qualified token; resolve provider through tiers + get_reviewers/get_planners) + updated cq.toml.example + token-format docs — unit-level acceptance, reuse T225's prior live evidence for the dispatch half","The above PLUS a fresh live dispatch demo showing `--provider ollama-cloud` is emitted and a minimax reviewer/planner run no longer abstains","The above PLUS asserting the @cq/config copy and the extension's inlined copy agree on the same token (a cross-layer consistency test or a recorded decisions item)"]
- recommendation: Unit tests in @cq/config + updated cq.toml.example + token-format docs, and rely on T225's already-recorded live `--provider ollama-cloud` evidence for the dispatch half (option a). A fresh live minimax run (option b) is the strongest closure of D36 if you want it, but it depends on ollama-cloud OAuth being available in the run environment; I'll plan it as a separate, clearly-marked acceptance-demo task if you want the live demonstration.
