- severity: low
- description: "Filed-and-deferred from the T225 review (opus + codex + grok all flagged it; out-of-scope for T225's resolver code, which faithfully maps whatever token the config supplies). In cq.toml.example (added by T223), `[aliases] minimax = \"pi:minimax-m3\"` + `[tiers] fast = \"minimax\"` resolve to the bare token `pi:minimax-m3` (no provider). Both the `ollama-cloud` provider (pi-ollama-cloud) and the MiniMax provider (pi-minimax-provider) register a `minimax-m3` model in nix/hm/dev-llm.nix, so the dispatch extension emits `--model minimax-m3` with NO `--provider`, leaving pi's non-deterministic fuzzy matching to pick the provider. The T225 live evidence used the disambiguated `pi:ollama-cloud/minimax-m3` form, confirming a specific provider is intended."
- suggestedFix: "In cq.toml.example, pin the provider-qualified token form: `minimax = \"pi:ollama-cloud/minimax-m3\"` (or whichever provider is canonical for minimax-m3) so tier resolution emits an explicit `--provider`. Optionally document the `pi:<provider>/<model>` token form in the cq.toml schema docs."

- headline: Home-manager ~/.pi/agent/settings.json registers a STALE pre-T225 cq-subagent-dispatch.ts store path
- severity: medium
- description: Filed-and-deferred from the T226 review (opus). The home-manager-activated ~/.pi/agent/settings.json points its dispatch extension at a nix-store path from BEFORE the T222/T224/T225 merge stack (HM activation has not been re-run since the merge). So a faithful end-to-end cq subagent dispatch under the locally-installed `pi` does NOT run the merged extension until home-manager is re-activated; the T226 demo had to work around it via a cloned PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR swapping in the repo's merged file. The projected ~/.pi/agent/cq-agents/<name>.md agent markdowns are byte-identical to the merged repo files, so only the EXTENSION code (not the agent contract) is stale. This is a USER/ENVIRONMENT action (re-run activation), not a repo code change.
- suggestedFix: Re-run `home-manager switch` (or the relevant activation) so ~/.pi/agent/settings.json registers the merged cq-subagent-dispatch.ts store path; then re-capture one dispatch under the unmodified locally-installed pi to confirm the merged extension loads without any PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR override.

- headline: Pi-path subagent child emits off-enum verdict ("fail") instead of the plan-review rubric's go-ahead|revise
- severity: medium
- description: "Filed-and-deferred from the T227 review (opus). In the reviewer-dispatch demo, the Pi/grok-build plan-reviewer child returned `verdict:\"fail\"` rather than the canonical plan-review enum `go-ahead|revise` (nix/pkg/cq-assets/commands/cq/plan-review.md:85). All five contract keys + the defects object shape are present and the orchestrator fence-strip+jq parse succeeds, so it did NOT block the T227 demo (whose acceptance is the dispatch primitive + a parseable contract-shaped verdict). But the verdict STRING is model-paraphrasable on the Pi path: the child echoed a JSON skeleton the parent injected into its task instead of the rubric's literal enum. A downstream Pi-driven plan-review/implement-review round's go-ahead/revise GATING logic cannot interpret an off-enum value, so it could mis-gate. Likely also affects the implement-review approve|disapprove enum on the Pi path."
- suggestedFix: "Two complementary layers. (1) Reinforce the enum on the Pi path: extend pi-context.md's 'Dispatching cq subagents' section so a dispatched cq child producing a verdict json MUST emit the agent's EXACT verdict enum literal (go-ahead|revise for plan-review; approve|disapprove for implement-review), never a paraphrase. (2) Add orchestrator-side fail-loud validation: in plan/advance.md and implement/advance.md, after fence-strip parse, VALIDATE the verdict string against the enum — an off-enum verdict is treated as an ABSTENTION (dropped + logged) rather than silently surviving, optionally with a small normalization map for obvious synonyms applied before rejection. This makes an off-enum value fail-loud instead of mis-gating."
- ledgerRefs: ["goals:G28","tasks:T227"]
- rootCause: "Confirmed (H27). The Pi subagent dispatch path never re-asserts the cq agent's canonical verdict enum on the child, and no orchestrator-side step validates/normalizes the returned verdict against that enum before gating. (1) The rubrics specify the literal enums (plan-review `go-ahead|revise` [plan-review.md:85]; implement-review `approve|disapprove` [implement-review.md:83]) — but that is the CHILD's instruction only. (2) The Pi dispatch trigger (pi-context.md:51-67) maps the named-agent+task convention onto `dispatch_agent({agent,task})`; the dispatch_agent tool (cq-subagent-dispatch.ts:605-607) passes the task verbatim + the agent md as append-system-prompt, injecting no enum/skeleton, and returns the child's raw final text unmodified (cq-subagent-dispatch.ts:687-694). (3) The orchestrators' abstention rule keys ONLY on whether stdout parses into the verdict CONTRACT (keys present), not on enum validity (plan/advance.md:291-299; implement/advance.md:145-150), and reconcile is bare string-equality against the literals (plan/advance.md:310-311; implement/advance.md:174-177). A Pi child can therefore paraphrase the verdict (e.g. \"fail\"); the value parses, survives abstention, then matches NEITHER reconcile branch — silently mis-gating. Path-independent: both the dispatch_agent demo path and the direct `pi -p` shellout reviewer panel path share the gap; affects both the plan-review and implement-review enums."

- fix: "Resolved via G31/M96 (T240-T244, all merged). Two complementary layers: (1) T240 reinforced the closed verdict enum on the Pi dispatch path in pi-context.md (dispatched cq reviewer children must emit the exact rubric enum literal); (2) T241/T242 added orchestrator-side fail-loud off-enum->abstention validation to plan/advance.md (go-ahead|revise) + implement/advance.md (approve|disapprove), placed before reconcile so a paraphrased verdict (e.g. 'fail') is dropped+logged instead of silently mis-gating. T243 verified (bun run check 1037/0 + nix build .#llm-contexts/.#llm-context-with-env/.#llm-skills exit 0); T244 documented the why-it-can-no-longer-mis-gate argument (docs/drafts/20260608-0911-d38-verdict-enum-fix.md).
