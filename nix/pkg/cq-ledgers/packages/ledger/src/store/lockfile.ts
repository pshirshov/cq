/**
 * Advisory lockfile with stale-PID reclaim.
 *
 * Layout: one lockfile per ledger at `<root>/.locks/<ledger>.lock`.
 * Content: JSON `{ pid, hostname, startedAt }`.
 *
 * Acquire algorithm:
 *  1. Ensure `.locks/` exists.
 *  2. Open the lockfile with `O_CREAT | O_EXCL | O_WRONLY`.
 *     - On success: write {pid, hostname, startedAt}, fsync, return release().
 *     - On EEXIST: read holder JSON.
 *       - If `pid` is not alive (probed by `process.kill(pid, 0)` which throws
 *         ESRCH), unlink the lockfile and retry the atomic acquire.
 *       - If `pid` IS alive, WAIT: poll the atomic acquire on a short interval
 *         until either it succeeds or `acquireTimeoutMs` elapses, then throw
 *         LedgerBusyError. cq has two legitimate concurrent ledger writers on
 *         one cwd (the in-process FsLedgerStore in the cq server and the
 *         long-lived cq-mcp child); the write-through critical section is short,
 *         so a bounded wait serialises them instead of failing the second writer
 *         (LOCK-D01). The timeout stays bounded so a genuinely stuck holder still
 *         surfaces LedgerBusyError.
 *
 * The `isPidAlive`, `now`, and `sleep` injection points let tests drive a live
 * holder, a fake clock, and deterministic polling without forking a real
 * process or sleeping in real time.
