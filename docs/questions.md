- question: "D2 does NOT reproduce from source — the requested auto-init already exists and works. To find the real root cause, what did you actually observe? Please provide: (a) the exact client error / how 'MCP connection fails' surfaced; (b) HOW the ledger MCP server was launched in that directory — from source (`bun … main.ts`), the Nix-built product (`nix build .#ledger-mcp`), or the globally plugin-registered (home-manager) binary [version skew is the prime suspect — see H3 / cf. D1]; (c) whether that directory even had a `.mcp.json` / plugin wiring the ledger server (no wiring = 'not configured', not a connection failure); (d) was it THIS repo or a different/empty project, and was the dir writable?"
- context: "Round 1 of investigation. H1 (server-startup registry-load throws) and H2 (FsLedgerStore construction/index-build throws) both adjudicated WRONG by orchestrator-verified citations + a live reproduction: FsLedgerStore.init() (packages/ledger/src/store/FsLedgerStore.ts:254-340), called by main() (packages/ledger-mcp/src/main.ts:337-344) BEFORE serving, mkdir's docs/ recursively, swallows ENOENT on the registry and each ledger file, writes EMPTY_REGISTRY, and bootstraps CANONICAL_LEDGERS. Reproduction: `bun packages/ledger-mcp/src/main.ts --cwd <fresh empty tmpdir>` printed 'serving stdio MCP', exited 0, and auto-created docs/ledgers.yaml + all canonical ledger files. So the source already does exactly what D2 requests. Remaining live hypothesis H3 (environmental: stale globally-registered/Nix binary version-skew like D1, or --cwd/.mcp.json wiring) needs your environment data to adjudicate. After answering, re-run /investigate:advance D2."
- suggestions: ["Most likely: the globally plugin-registered (home-manager/Nix) ledger-mcp binary is older than the source that has the auto-init — rebuild/refresh it (version skew, cf. D1) and retest","The directory had no .mcp.json wiring the ledger server (so it was never configured, not a 'connection failure')","A --cwd resolved to a non-existent or unwritable path","Something else — paste the actual error"]
- recommendation: Capture the exact failure + launch method; if it's the globally-registered binary, rebuild it and retest before we plan any code fix (source already auto-inits, so a code change may be unnecessary).
- ledgerRefs: ["defects:D2","hypothesis:H3"]
- answer: "User-provided actual error: `ledger-mcp: fatal: Bootstrap invariant violated: existing goals ledger has a different schema than its canonical bootstrap schema`. So the failure is NOT missing-init (the empty-dir auto-init works) — it is the BootstrapViolationError thrown by FsLedgerStore.init() (packages/ledger/src/store/FsLedgerStore.ts:283-289) when an EXISTING on-disk ledger's schema diverges from its CANONICAL_LEDGERS bootstrap schema (e.g. a stale/version-skewed binary vs an evolved docs/ledgers.yaml). Confirms the H3 environmental direction. Desired fix (user): on such a divergence, automatically BACK UP the old/divergent ledger files and set up fresh canonical ledgers, instead of aborting with a fatal error."

- author: user
- session: ea0ee283-9e2d-4088-a61a-86fac464e29b
- question: Which convenience surface(s) do you want built? (a) a single state-overview/snapshot MCP tool returning the actionable set in one call; (b) a generic compact/projection + pagination mode on fetch_ledger; (c) better tool/field/query-language descriptions only (docs); or some combination?
- context: These are the four candidate directions in the goal, and they are not mutually exclusive but they have very different cost/blast-radius. The repo today has 14 read tools but no cross-ledger snapshot, no projection, and the fts query help is already embedded in the tool description + server instructions. A snapshot tool (a) directly kills evidence #1/#4 (the ~13 bootstrap calls); a projection mode (b) directly kills evidence #2 (token overflow) and is reusable beyond /advance; docs (c) address evidence #3 and are nearly free. I can scope any subset.
- suggestions: ["All of a+b+c (snapshot tool + fetch_ledger projection/pagination + doc improvements) — covers every piece of evidence, a+c only (snapshot tool + docs) — the snapshot is /advance-shaped and can itself be compact, deferring a generic projection, b+c only (projection/pagination + docs) — generic, reusable building blocks","let agents compose predicates from compact reads, c only — documentation/recipes, no new endpoints"]
- recommendation: All of a+b+c. The snapshot tool removes the bootstrap round-trips, the projection mode is a small reusable fix for the token-overflow that also benefits the snapshot, and the doc improvements are cheap. The grounding shows columns.ts already provides LONG_FIELD_DENYLIST as the projection building block, so (b) is low-cost.

- author: user
- session: ea0ee283-9e2d-4088-a61a-86fac464e29b
- question: If we build a state-overview/snapshot tool, what exactly should it return — and should it be generic or /advance-predicate-shaped? E.g. counts + item ids grouped by ledger×status; or a curated 'actionable set' (open/wip defects, movable-phase goals, DAG-ready tasks, open questions) shaped to the three /advance detection predicates?
- context: "Evidence #1/#4: deriving the three /advance predicates (P-investigate=actionable defects, P-plan=movable-phase goals, P-implement=DAG-ready tasks, + open-questions gate) took ~13 calls. A generic ledger×status grouping (with ids) is reusable by any agent/UI and stays decoupled from flow semantics; a predicate-shaped summary is maximally convenient for /advance but bakes flow knowledge (phase movability, DAG-readiness) into the ledger library, which currently has none. enumerate_ledgers already returns per-ledger counts but no status breakdown and no ids."
- suggestions: ["Generic: { ledger: { status: { count, ids[] } } } across all active ledgers — one call gives every predicate its raw inputs; agent composes the predicates","Generic + compact item stubs: same grouping but each entry is {id, status, summary} (headline/title/question) so the agent rarely needs a follow-up fetch","Predicate-shaped: an /advance-tailored payload (actionableDefects[], movableGoals[], readyTasks[], openQuestions[]) computing phase-movability and DAG-readiness server-side","Both: a generic grouping tool now, leave predicate logic in the flow prompts"]
- recommendation: "Generic + compact item stubs ({id,status,summary} grouped by ledger×status). It collapses the bootstrap to ~1 call, stays flow-agnostic (no DAG/phase semantics leaking into @cq/ledger), is reusable by the TUI/web and any future flow, and the {id,status,summary} stub avoids most follow-up fetches. DAG-readiness/phase-movability stay in the flow prompts where the flow vocabulary already lives."

- author: user
- session: ea0ee283-9e2d-4088-a61a-86fac464e29b
- question: For the fetch_ledger token-overflow (evidence #2), do you prefer a compact PROJECTION mode (omit long narrative fields, return id+status+summary+short fields), PAGINATION (offset/limit chunks of full items), or BOTH? And should projection be a new parameter on fetch_ledger or a separate tool?
- context: "Evidence #2: goals=51.8KB and questions=142.7KB overflowed the tool-output token limit because fetch_ledger returns every item's full long fields. columns.ts already defines LONG_FIELD_DENYLIST (description/rationale/criticism/context/alternatives/evidence/completion/answer/rootCause/suggestedFix/fix) that the frontends use to render compact tables — a projection mode could reuse it directly. Projection fixes the common case (you rarely need every long field at once); pagination guarantees you can always page through full content; they compose. A new parameter keeps the tool count at 14; a separate tool keeps fetch_ledger's contract unchanged."
- suggestions: ["Projection only, as a `summary: true` (or `fields: 'compact'`) param on fetch_ledger reusing LONG_FIELD_DENYLIST — smallest change, kills the overflow for reads","Projection + pagination, both as params on fetch_ledger — compact by default-ish, page through full items when needed","Pagination only (offset/limit of full items) — no field model, but large items can still individually overflow","A separate compact-read tool, leaving fetch_ledger untouched"]
- recommendation: Projection as a param on fetch_ledger (reusing LONG_FIELD_DENYLIST), plus optional pagination on the same tool. Projection alone resolves the observed overflow with a single small reusable change; adding offset/limit makes the full-content path safe for any future growth. Keeping both as params on fetch_ledger avoids inflating the tool surface.

- session: ea0ee283-9e2d-4088-a61a-86fac464e29b
- question: "For the fts status-filter confusion (evidence #3): before any documentation work, should we treat the observed-empty `(status:open OR status:wip)` result as a SUSPECTED DEFECT to reproduce-and-fix, or assume it was a usage/stale-index artifact and fix only the documentation?"
- context: "Grounding: the query evaluator should match an OR-of-qualifiers per item (an empty query node returns false, but a qualifier node is evaluated against each item). So `(status:open OR status:wip)` returning empty over a populated ledger is unexpected and may be a real defect in OR-of-qualifier evaluation or in how the inline `status:` qualifier interacts with the dedicated `status:` param (two distinct code paths). Per repo policy (reproduce-before-fix), if it is a defect we must write a failing test first. This determines whether G11 carries a fix task + a defects record, or is purely docs for evidence #3."
- suggestions: ["Reproduce first: add a failing test for `(status:open OR status:wip)`; if it confirms a defect, G11 includes a fix task + defects record; then document the corrected behaviour","Docs only: assume usage/stale-index artifact, just clarify the query language (status param vs inline qualifier, active-vs-archived, terminal semantics) at point of use","Out of scope: file any confirmed defect separately and keep G11 to convenience surfaces + docs"]
- recommendation: "Reproduce first. The behaviour is unexpected per the evaluator's design, and repo policy forbids shipping a doc 'explanation' for what may be a real OR-of-qualifier defect. A 10-line test settles it: if green, it was usage and we document; if red, we have a reproduced defect to fix within G11 (or file-and-defer)."

- author: user
- session: ea0ee283-9e2d-4088-a61a-86fac464e29b
- question: "For the archive/terminal footgun (evidence #5): which remedy do you want — (a) a reopen-terminal capability (move a terminal item back to a non-terminal status), (b) an un-archive capability (pull an archived item/group back out of ./archive), (c) a GUARD on the auto-archive sweep (e.g. don't sweep an item whose terminal status was set within N seconds, or require an explicit confirm), or (d) leave it out of G11 and track as a separate defect?"
- context: "Evidence #5: D22 was accidentally set `resolved`, the auto-archive sweep moved it to ./archive, and recovery required re-filing as D24. Grounding: terminal statuses have [] outgoing transitions in each schema's `transitions` map (so reopen needs either a new transition edge or a guard-bypassing store op), and archiveMilestone has NO inverse (un-archive needs a new store method to restore from ./archive/<ledger>/<id>.md). A sweep-guard prevents the accident; reopen/un-archive enable recovery after it. These address different points in the failure chain and can combine."
- suggestions: ["Reopen-terminal only: a store op (+ MCP tool) to move a terminal item back to a chosen non-terminal status; simplest recovery, no archive surgery","Un-archive only: restore an archived item/group back to active; recovers the already-archived case (the actual D22 situation)","Sweep-guard only: prevent the auto-archive sweep from acting on a freshly-set or erroneous terminal status (prevention, not recovery)","Reopen + un-archive (full recovery path), defer the sweep-guard","Out of scope for G11: file as a separate defect/improvement"]
- recommendation: Reopen-terminal + un-archive (the full recovery path), and defer the sweep-guard to a follow-up. Recovery primitives are general-purpose and directly undo the D22-class accident regardless of how it occurred; a sweep-guard is a heuristic that is easy to get wrong and only addresses one trigger. If you want minimum scope, pick un-archive only, since that matches the exact D22 situation (already archived).

- author: user
- session: ea0ee283-9e2d-4088-a61a-86fac464e29b
- question: "Where should the improved query-language / state-derivation documentation live, and who is the audience? Options: the MCP server `instructions` string (seen by every connecting agent), the per-tool descriptions (seen when the tool is invoked), the flow-command prompt files under llm/commands/** (seen by /advance et al.), the repo CLAUDE.md, or several of these?"
- context: "Evidence #3 is partly a docs problem. Grounding: QUERY_LANGUAGE_HELP is ALREADY embedded in both the fts_search tool description and the server instructions — so the gap is not 'undocumented' but 'the existing doc didn't make the status-param-vs-inline distinction and terminal/active semantics obvious at point of use'. The /advance bootstrap recipe (how to derive the predicates in few calls) is flow-specific and arguably belongs in the flow prompts, not the generic server instructions. Audience matters: server instructions reach ALL agents/projects using this MCP; flow prompts reach only this repo's flows."
- suggestions: ["Server instructions + per-tool descriptions only — fix the generic query-language doc (status param vs inline, active-vs-archived, terminal semantics) at point of use; keep it project-agnostic","Server/tool docs for the query language, PLUS a /advance bootstrap recipe in the flow-command prompts (llm/commands/**) referencing the new snapshot tool","All of the above plus a short note in repo CLAUDE.md","Flow prompts only — treat it as a /advance usage issue, leave the MCP docs as-is"]
- recommendation: Server instructions + per-tool descriptions for the GENERIC query-language clarifications (project-agnostic, reaches every agent), PLUS a short /advance bootstrap recipe in the flow-command prompts that points at whatever snapshot/projection surface we build. This puts each piece of documentation where its audience actually reads it and avoids leaking flow specifics into the generic MCP server.

- author: user
- session: ea0ee283-9e2d-4088-a61a-86fac464e29b
- question: "Any scope boundaries or constraints for G11 beyond 'pass bun run check'? Specifically: is it acceptable to GROW the MCP tool count beyond 14 (the surface is described as '14 tools' in code comments and tests), and must every new capability be exposed over MCP (so the TUI/web pure-MCP clients can use it), or are server-side-only store helpers acceptable for some pieces?"
- context: "Grounding: ledgerTools.ts and main.ts both hardcode/comment '14 tools', and LEDGER_TOOL_NAMES is a fixed list that tests assert against — adding a snapshot tool and/or un-archive/reopen tools bumps that count and touches those assertions. Project convention: frontends are pure MCP clients and never read docs/ directly, so any capability they need must be an MCP tool; but a pure store helper that only the snapshot tool consumes need not be its own tool. Knowing the tolerance for new tools vs. new params on existing tools shapes the whole plan (new tools vs. overloaded params)."
- suggestions: ["Growing the tool count is fine — add as many well-named tools as the design needs; update the '14 tools' comments/tests accordingly","Prefer minimal new tools — add params to existing tools (fetch_ledger projection, etc.) and only add a tool where no existing one fits (e.g. the snapshot, un-archive)","Keep the surface as small as possible — favour documentation + params over any new tool","No constraint beyond bun run check — use engineering judgment"]
- recommendation: "Prefer minimal new tools: add params to existing tools where they fit (fetch_ledger projection/pagination) and add a new tool only where no existing one fits (the cross-ledger snapshot; reopen/un-archive operations). Update the '14 tools' comments and LEDGER_TOOL_NAMES + their tests as part of the change. Every agent-facing capability must be an MCP tool (pure-client frontends); internal store helpers need not be."

- question: "F1 (click-protection): which set of buttons gets the click-and-hold gate — (a) ALL state-mutating action buttons (every status-transition save PLUS the answer buttons: per-suggestion 'pick', 'as recommended', 'save & mark answered' in both the detail panel AND the BatchAnswerModal); (b) DESTRUCTIVE/irreversible-only (e.g. transitions INTO a terminal status, abandon/wontfix, and overwriting a stored answer) while ordinary saves stay single-click; or (c) a configurable subset?"
- context: "Grounding (packages/ledger-web/src/App.tsx): there are exactly these state-mutating action buttons today — (1) the DetailPanel 'save' button (status transition + field edits, driven by the controlled status <select>), (2) the BatchAnswerModal buttons data-testid 'batch-answer-submit' ('save & mark answered'), 'batch-answer-as-recommended' ('as recommended'), and per-suggestion 'batch-pick-suggestion-N' ('pick'), and (3) the analogous detail-panel answerBox buttons. The user's verbatim list ('transition buttons plus pick answer/as recommended/save answer') reads as ALL of them, but confirming scope (a vs b) sets how many call sites get the hold wrapper and whether the +item/+milestone create-save also counts. The 'show archived', filter selects, column toggles, and navigation are NOT state-mutating and are out of scope either way."
- suggestions: ["(a) ALL state-mutating action buttons — uniform: every save + every answer button (detail panel and batch modal) gets the hold gate; simplest mental model, no per-button policy","(b) Destructive/irreversible-only — gate transitions into terminal statuses, abandon/wontfix/withdraw, and answer-overwrite; leave forward/non-destructive saves single-click","(c) ALL state-transition + answer buttons EXCEPT pure field edits with no status change","Make it a per-button 'requireHold' prop so the policy is decided at each call site and trivially adjustable later"]
- recommendation: (a) ALL state-mutating action buttons. The user enumerated transition + pick + as-recommended + save-answer explicitly, which is the full action set; a uniform hold gate on every mutating button is the least surprising and avoids a brittle destructive/non-destructive classification that the schema does not currently express. Implement it as a single reusable HoldButton wrapping each call site (so a future policy split is a one-line change), defaulting every current mutating button to require-hold.

- question: "F1 (hold UX details): confirm the interaction contract — (i) hold duration (~1s as proposed?); (ii) RELEASE-before-complete = cancel (action does NOT fire) and the progress bar resets; (iii) the keyboard/non-mouse accessible path (since hold-to-confirm is pointer-centric) — e.g. Enter/Space starts the hold while held down, or a focused button shows a separate confirm affordance; (iv) does the TUI (@cq/ledger-tui) need a PARALLEL confirm affordance for its analogous keybindings, or is click-protection WEB-ONLY this round?"
- context: "Grounding: ledger-web inputs are uncontrolled-via-ref and selects controlled specifically because happy-dom does not fire onChange for synthetic events on controlled text inputs (CLAUDE.md + App.tsx header comment) — a hold interaction driven by pointerdown/pointerup + a timer + a progress element must be DRIVABLE under happy-dom (the test harness), which can dispatch pointerdown/pointerup/keydown but advancing a real ~1s timer needs fake timers. The TUI (packages/ledger-tui) uses ink keybindings for the same transitions/answers (the user said 'web ui' specifically), so a TUI parallel is plausibly out of scope but should be confirmed rather than assumed. Keyboard accessibility matters because a pure pointer-hold strands keyboard-only users."
- suggestions: ["1000ms hold; release-before-complete cancels and resets the bar; keyboard path = press-and-hold Enter or Space on the focused button (keydown starts, keyup before threshold cancels); WEB-ONLY (no TUI change this round)","Same timing/cancel, but keyboard uses a two-step confirm (first activation arms, second within N s confirms) instead of held-key, since key-repeat semantics vary","Configurable duration (default 1000ms) exposed as a constant; cancel-on-release; web-only","Include a TUI parallel (a hold/confirm keybinding) so both clients are hardened symmetrically"]
- recommendation: 1000ms; release-before-complete cancels and resets; keyboard path = hold Enter/Space on the focused button (keydown arms + starts the progress, keyup before the threshold cancels), so the affordance is identical across input modalities; WEB-ONLY this round (the user said 'web ui'; a TUI confirm can be a separate follow-up goal if wanted). Drive it in tests with fake timers + dispatched pointer/key events. Expose the duration as a named constant (HOLD_MS) rather than a magic literal.

- question: "F2 (handoffs ledger — status enum + idPrefix): confirm the full ALL-TERMINAL status set. Proposed: drained | answers-required | illness-detected. The /advance end-of-run categories are DRAINED / BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS / MIXED — do you want a status per category (so BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS→answers-required and MIXED→a 'mixed'/'progress-with-blocks' status), plus 'illness-detected' for an aborted/errored run? And which idPrefix (M/D/T/H/Q/K/G/R are taken — 'HO' or 'X' are free)?"
- context: "Grounding: every CANONICAL_LEDGERS schema (packages/ledger/src/constants.ts) is {statusValues, terminalStatuses, idPrefix, transitions, fields}; an all-terminal ledger has every status in terminalStatuses with empty transition arrays (REVIEWS_SCHEMA is the existing precedent — go-ahead|revise, both terminal, transitions {go-ahead:[], revise:[]}). idPrefixes M,D,T,H,Q,K,G,R are all in use, so handoffs needs a new one. The /advance report (llm/commands/advance.md) classifies a run as exactly one of DRAINED / BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS / MIXED — if a handoff item is written per stop, the status should encode that classification, and 'illness-detected' covers a stop that is neither (an error/abort the user flagged). The user said 'maybe smth else', so the enum is genuinely open."
- suggestions: ["drained | answers-required | illness-detected (3, verbatim) — map BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS→answers-required; fold MIXED into drained-or-answers-required by dominant reason; idPrefix 'HO'","drained | answers-required | mixed | illness-detected (4) — one status per /advance category PLUS illness; idPrefix 'HO'","drained | answers-required | illness-detected | aborted | failed (5) — separate a user-aborted run from an internal error; idPrefix 'X'","Keep status to the 3 proposed and carry the finer category (mixed/aborted/error) in an explanatory field, not the enum"]
- recommendation: "drained | answers-required | mixed | illness-detected (4 statuses, all terminal), idPrefix 'HO'. This maps 1:1 onto the /advance report categories (DRAINED→drained, BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS→answers-required, MIXED→mixed) so a handoff record IS the persisted run classification, plus 'illness-detected' for the user's explicit error/abort case. All-terminal mirrors REVIEWS_SCHEMA exactly. Avoid over-splitting (aborted/failed) until a flow actually needs to distinguish them — the explanation field carries the detail."
- ledgerRefs: ["goals:G11"]

- question: "F2 (handoffs ledger — item shape + fields): besides the intrinsic status(=reason), what fields should a handoff item carry? Proposed: a required 'summary'/'explanation' (the human-readable why), the COMMON_REF_FIELDS (ledgerRefs to the goals/defects/questions/tasks that caused the stop, plus tags/sourceRefs), and — since handoffs are run records — possibly an explicit 'flow' field (which command stopped: advance/plan/implement/investigate) and a 'blockingQuestions' id[] (the open questions enumerated in a BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS report). Append-only history (no edits after creation)?"
- context: "Grounding: COMMON_REF_FIELDS (sourceRefs/blockedBy/dependsOn/ledgerRefs/tags/suggestedModel) is spread into defects/tasks/hypothesis/questions/decisions; REVIEWS_SCHEMA instead carries a bespoke subset (summary/new_questions/criticism/ledgerRefs/tags/sourceRefs) — so there is precedent for a tailored field set on a record-style ledger. The /advance BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS report already enumerates each blocking question by id with its owning item (defects:<D>/goals:<G>/tasks:<id>) — that maps directly to ledgerRefs + an optional blockingQuestions id[]. The intrinsic author/session fields already record WHO wrote the item and the session, so a separate 'session' schema field may be redundant. Each item also has intrinsic createdAt, giving append-only history for free if items are never updated."
- suggestions: ["summary (required) + ledgerRefs + tags + sourceRefs (reuse the REVIEWS-style subset); rely on intrinsic author/session/createdAt for provenance + ordering; append-only","Above PLUS a 'flow' string (advance|plan|implement|investigate) and a 'blockingQuestions' id[] mirroring the BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS enumeration","Full COMMON_REF_FIELDS + summary + flow + blockingQuestions — maximally linkable","summary + ledgerRefs only — minimal; everything else lives in the prose summary"]

'flow' makes the record queryable by which command stopped, and 'blockingQuestions' makes a BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS handoff directly actionable (the user can navigate to the exact open questions). This stays close to the REVIEWS precedent rather than inventing a wholly new field vocabulary."

- question: "F2 (who writes handoffs, and at which stop points): WHICH flows record a handoff, and does writing one VIOLATE the current read-only invariant of /advance? Today llm/commands/advance.md explicitly makes NO ledger writes of its own ('every write is performed by a chained sub-command'). A handoff record at the /advance stop would be a NEW write by the top-level sequencer. Do you want: (a) ONLY /advance writes a handoff at its end-of-run classification (accepting that /advance gains one write, narrowly scoped to the handoffs ledger); (b) EACH flow (plan/implement/investigate) also writes a handoff when ITS own loop stops; or (c) only /advance, and the per-flow commands stay silent?"
- context: "Grounding: advance.md §Provenance: 'This command makes NO ledger writes of its own (read-only detection only).' Adding a handoff write changes that invariant for exactly one ledger. The per-flow advance commands (plan/implement/investigate) DO write (they own all mutations), so they could each emit a handoff at their stop without breaking any invariant — but that risks duplicate/overlapping handoffs when /advance chains them (each sub-flow stop PLUS the /advance stop). The natural single-writer is /advance (it owns the DRAINED/BLOCKED/MIXED classification); the natural multi-writer story is 'every flow logs why it stopped' (richer audit, but needs a rule to avoid double-recording within a chained run)."
- suggestions: ["(a) ONLY /advance writes one handoff at end-of-run (its DRAINED/BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS/MIXED classification); update advance.md §Provenance to permit this single handoffs write; per-flow commands stay silent","(b) EACH flow writes a handoff when run STANDALONE; when chained under /advance, the SUB-flow suppresses its handoff and only /advance writes the run-level one (avoids duplicates)","(c) Every flow ALWAYS writes its own handoff at every stop (full per-stop audit trail), accepting multiple handoffs per /advance run","(d) Defer: build the handoffs ledger + schema now, wire the WRITERS in a follow-up once the schema is agreed"]
- recommendation: "(b): each per-flow command writes a handoff when invoked STANDALONE, but when chained under /advance the sub-flow suppresses its own handoff and /advance writes the single run-level record carrying its DRAINED/BLOCKED/MIXED classification. This gives one authoritative handoff per top-level run (no duplicates) while still recording a stop when a flow is run on its own. It does require amending advance.md's read-only §Provenance note to allow exactly the handoffs write — call that out explicitly in the plan. If you prefer to keep /advance strictly read-only, pick (a)-with-no-/advance-write is not possible (then nothing records the run-level stop), so (a) as written (allow the one write) is the fallback."

Candidates: tasks (the implement worker writes a log per task), reviews (the reviewer logs its round), defects/hypothesis (investigate explorers log per round), goals (the planner logs per planning round), and the NEW handoffs ledger. Field NAME + TYPE: 'sessionLogs' as string[] of repo-relative log PATHS, or 'logRefs' as string[] of agent-ids, or fold into the existing 'sourceRefs' string[] that several schemas already carry?"
- context: "Grounding: each flow already writes per-subagent logs to docs/logs/<timestamp>-<agent-id>.md (advance.md §Session logs: 'Each chained sub-command logs ITS subagents to docs/logs/ per that command's own §Session logs rule'). COMMON_REF_FIELDS already includes 'sourceRefs: string[]' on defects/tasks/hypothesis/questions/decisions — a path-typed log link could either reuse sourceRefs (no schema change, but mixes provenance kinds) or be a dedicated field added to COMMON_REF_FIELDS (one edit propagates to all ledgers that spread it) plus REVIEWS_SCHEMA and the new handoffs schema (which carry bespoke field sets). The user said 'everywhere where it makes sense' — the work-producing ledgers (tasks/reviews/defects/hypothesis/goals/handoffs) are where a session log exists; questions/decisions are user/record artifacts that may not have one."

Paths over agent-ids so the link resolves without re-deriving the filename. A dedicated field over reusing sourceRefs keeps log-provenance distinct from other source references and lets the TUI/web render it as a distinct 'logs' relationship.

- question: "F3 (who populates sessionLogs, and should the TUI/web RENDER it): WHO writes the link and WHEN — the orchestrator/command that writes the docs/logs/<ts>-<agent-id>.md file (it already knows the agent-id↔item mapping), populating sessionLogs as part of the same update that sets the item terminal? And must the frontends render it — as a clickable link / relationship panel (like the existing fix-tasks and hypothesis-tree panels), or is it a plain display field this round?"
- context: "Grounding: the flow commands write the session log AND own the item mutations (e.g. implement worker marks its task done; planner advances the goal), so they are the natural populators — the link would be set in the same update_item that records the work outcome. Frontends are PURE MCP clients (CLAUDE.md): App.tsx already renders cross-ledger relationship panels for defects↔fix-tasks and hypothesis trees (defectFixTaskIds/hypothesisRelationships from @cq/ledger/relationships) and shows ordered short/long fields; a sessionLogs field would render as a plain list unless given dedicated treatment. Logs live on the FILESYSTEM under docs/logs/, not in the ledger, so a web 'open log' action would need a way to read the file — which the pure-MCP-client web app has no tool for today (it never reads docs/ directly). That constrains whether 'clickable' is even feasible this round."
- suggestions: ["Populated by the writing command in the same update_item that records the outcome; frontends render sessionLogs as a PLAIN display field (list of paths) — no file-opening, respecting the pure-MCP-client boundary","Same population; TUI/web render it as a labeled 'logs' section but paths are non-clickable text (no MCP tool reads files)","Populated by the writing command; ADD an MCP tool to fetch a log file's contents so the web can open it in-app — larger scope, crosses the 'frontends never read docs/ directly' line via a proper MCP read tool","Populate now, defer ALL frontend rendering to a follow-up"]
- recommendation: "Populated by the command that writes the log, in the SAME update_item that records the work outcome (it holds the agent-id↔item mapping); frontends render sessionLogs as a PLAIN display field (a labeled list of paths) this round, NON-clickable. Opening a log in-app would require a new MCP read-file tool (the web app cannot read docs/ directly per the pure-client rule) — that is worth a separate decision and should NOT be bundled into F3.

- question: "FEATURE 1 — which explorer-RW design do you want planned? (a) grant the explorer write/Bash tools directly with a 'avoid writing unless necessary' instruction; (b) the explorer RETURNS a structured RW-permission request and the orchestrator RE-RUNS it with extended permissions; or (c) my proposed third option — a TWO-TIER explorer: keep the default read-only explorer exactly as-is, and add a SECOND agent definition (an 'investigate-prober' with Bash + an isolated git WORKTREE) that the orchestrator dispatches ONLY when an explorer's returned JSON sets a new `needsRW`/`probeRequest` field, with all writes confined to a throwaway worktree the orchestrator discards after harvesting evidence?"
- context: "Grounding: investigate-explorer.md sets `disallowedTools: Write,Edit,MultiEdit,NotebookEdit,Bash,Agent` and the body explicitly states it 'shares the main checkout (no worktree isolation) because you change nothing'. The orchestrator (commands/investigate/advance.md) re-validates EVERY returned citation against source before trusting it — the read-only + no-worktree invariant is load-bearing for that trust model. Option (a) breaks both invariants (an explorer running Bash in the shared main checkout can mutate the very files later explorers cite, and there is no worktree to contain it). Option (b) already has a clean seam: the explorer returns a fenced-json block {hypothesisId, evidence[], lean, notes} that the orchestrator parses — adding a permission-request field is a minimal, in-contract extension. Option (c) is (b) plus isolation: it preserves the read-only explorer untouched and adds a separate, worktree-isolated prober so RW probing never contaminates the evidence checkout. This choice drives whether we edit ONE agent file or add a SECOND, and how much of investigate/advance.md changes."
- suggestions: ["(c) two-tier: read-only explorer unchanged + a new worktree-isolated investigate-prober dispatched on a returned needsRW request; writes confined to a throwaway worktree","(b) single explorer returns an RW-permission request; orchestrator re-runs the SAME explorer with extended tools (decide whether in the shared checkout or a fresh worktree)","(a) grant the existing explorer Bash/write directly with an 'avoid unless necessary' instruction (simplest, but breaks the read-only + no-worktree trust invariants)"]
- recommendation: "(c) two-tier with a worktree-isolated prober. It keeps the read-only explorer and the orchestrator's citation-revalidation trust model intact, and confines any write/Bash side effects to a throwaway worktree the orchestrator discards — so RW probing can never mutate files that other explorers cite in the shared checkout. The probe trigger reuses the EXISTING json return seam (a new field like `probeRequest`), mirroring how implement-flow already dispatches worktree-isolated workers. If you prefer minimal surface area, (b) is acceptable but should still run the re-run in a fresh worktree, not the shared main checkout. (a) I recommend against: it silently breaks the invariant that makes explorer evidence trustworthy."

Also: should an RW probe ever be allowed to touch the network (curl/git fetch), or only the local repo?"
- context: "The goal names only the investigate:* flow. Within it, the legitimate need is usually to RUN something to gather evidence (execute a repro script, run `bun test`, `git log`/`git diff`, build) rather than to PERMANENTLY edit tracked files — the actual fix is always file-and-deferred to plan/implement, never done by the explorer. Pinning 'read + execute-in-a-throwaway-worktree, no persisted repo edits' keeps the explorer's evidence reproducible and keeps the fix boundary clean. Network access is a separate axis (some repros need a fetch; most don't) and affects sandbox/permission wiring."
- suggestions: ["investigate:* only; probe = read + EXECUTE (bash/tests/build/git) inside a throwaway worktree; NO persisted edits to the main checkout; local-only, no network by default","investigate:* only; allow real edits too, but ONLY inside the throwaway worktree (discarded after evidence harvest)","broader: also let plan/implement reviewers request execute access (out of scope for this goal — defer)","allow network (curl/git fetch) during a probe when the repro needs it"]
- recommendation: "investigate:* only; the probe is READ + EXECUTE (run repros, tests, builds, git inspection) inside a throwaway worktree, with NO persisted edits to the main checkout and local-only (no network) by default. This covers the real need ('I must RUN this to see what happens') without weakening the file-and-defer fix boundary or the citation-revalidation trust model.

- question: "FEATURE 2 invocation mechanism — confirm HOW a non-Claude reviewer is launched. Claude reviewers are NATIVE Agent-tool subagents (subagent_type: plan-reviewer / implement-reviewer). `pi` and `codex` have no Agent/subagent mechanism — they are separate CLI harnesses. So a `pi:grok-build` or `pi:gpt-5.5` reviewer = the orchestrator shells out via Bash to `pi -p <prompt>` / `codex exec <prompt>` (selecting model via the CLI's flags) in a read-only checkout, capturing the same structured-JSON review contract on stdout. Is that the intended model, and is `pi`/`codex` actually invocable non-interactively from inside a Claude-Code orchestrator session in this sandbox?"
- context: "Grounding (nix/hm/dev-llm.nix): programs.{claude-code,codex,pi} are three independent CLI harnesses. pi is wrapped (piWrapped) with provider/search keys, defaults to provider+model grok-build, and also has openai-codex/openai/openrouter providers; codex defaults to gpt-5.5. The reviewer subagents return STRUCTURED JSON (implement-reviewer: a fenced json {verdict,criticism,questions,defects,...}; plan-reviewer writes a reviews item) that the orchestrator parses. For a pi/codex process to participate in reconciliation it must emit the SAME json contract on stdout, which means the reviewer PROMPT must be delivered to pi/codex (they already receive mergedCommands as prompt templates / ~/.codex/prompts, but the AGENT definitions are Claude-only — agents are intentionally not materialized for codex/pi). This determines whether we (i) ship the reviewer instructions as a shared PROMPT both CLIs can run, and (ii) whether the orchestrator can spawn these CLIs at all from within its session (sandbox/nesting/auth constraints)."
- suggestions: ["Yes: orchestrator shells out via Bash to `pi`/`codex` non-interactively (e.g. pi -p / codex exec) with a shared reviewer PROMPT, captures the json contract on stdout; Claude reviewers stay native Agent subagents","Same, but ALSO materialize the reviewer instructions as a shared command/prompt for pi/codex (since agent defs are Claude-only today)","pi/codex cannot be invoked from inside the orchestrator session here — reviewers must all be Claude models for now (descope the pi/codex half)","Unsure — first task should be a spike to verify `pi -p`/`codex exec` run non-interactively and return parseable output in this sandbox"]
- recommendation: Yes — the orchestrator shells out via Bash to `pi`/`codex` non-interactively with a SHARED reviewer prompt and parses the same structured-JSON contract from stdout, while Claude reviewers remain native Agent subagents. Because the existing reviewer instructions live in Claude-only AGENT files, the plan should also extract the reviewer rubric into a shared prompt/command both CLIs can run. I recommend the FIRST planned task be a small spike that confirms `pi -p <prompt>` and `codex exec` actually run non-interactively in this sandbox and emit parseable JSON — the whole feature's task shape depends on that being true, so we should de-risk it before planning the reconciliation tasks.

- answer: "as recommended, we use shell. But you misunderstood me: I don't want to use codex cli directly. I have codex (gpt-5.5 provided by openai-codex) (already configured in pi, same as grok (grok-build provided by grok-build. We can stick with just using pi."

Which?"
- context: "This is the core behavioural decision of the feature and is underspecified by 'reconciles their outputs'. The downstream loops act on the recorded findings: plan-flow's planner reads the latest review's criticism/new_questions/defects; implement-flow's criticism loop fixes criticism[] and parks on questions[]. If findings are UNIONed, a single reviews item must aggregate multiple reviewers' outputs (and provenance — which reviewer said what). Strictest-wins maximizes safety (no real defect is dropped because one model missed it) and composes cleanly with the existing 'revise requires non-empty criticism/new_questions' invariant. Majority/primary risks dropping a valid finding a minority reviewer alone caught."

- recommendation: "(i) Strictest-wins on the verdict + UNION of all reviewers' criticism/questions/defects, with each finding tagged by its source reviewer (e.g. a `[pi:grok-build]` prefix or a reviewer field), aggregated into the single reviews item the round records. This preserves the existing state-machine invariants (a 'revise'/'disapprove' from ANY reviewer keeps the loop iterating; go-ahead requires unanimity), never drops a real defect a minority model alone caught, and keeps provenance auditable.

- question: "FEATURE 2 — cq.toml location, schema, and WHO reads it. (a) Is `cq.toml` per-REPO (committed at the repo root, read by the orchestrator command at the start of each review) or per-USER (home dir)? (b) Does the same reviewer set apply to BOTH plan-flow and implement-flow reviews, or do you want per-flow keys (e.g. `[reviewers] plan = [...] implement = [...]`)? (c) Is the whole feature OFF unless cq.toml exists (default = today's single Claude reviewer), so absence is a no-op?"
- context: "There is NO cq.toml today and no code that reads one — it's net-new. The orchestrators are prompt files (commands/*/advance.md) with `allowed-tools: ... Bash, Read`, so 'read cq.toml' means a Read/Bash step at the top of the review phase, not new MCP/TS code (unless you want a typed parser in @cq/ledger). Per-repo+committed makes the reviewer set travel with the project and be diffable; per-user makes it a personal default. Defaulting the feature OFF when cq.toml is absent preserves today's exact behaviour (one native Claude reviewer) for repos that don't opt in. The token format `claude:opus` / `pi:grok-build` / `pi:gpt-5.5` already encodes `<harness>:<model>`; confirm that's the canonical schema and that `claude:<model>` maps to the native Agent subagent path while `pi:*`/`codex:*` map to the CLI-shellout path."
- suggestions: ["Per-REPO cq.toml at repo root, committed","ONE `reviewers = [...]` list shared by plan+implement","feature OFF (single native Claude reviewer) when the file/key is absent, Per-repo cq.toml, but PER-FLOW keys ([reviewers] plan=[...] implement=[...]) so the sets can differ, Per-USER cq.toml (home dir) as a personal default, overridable per-repo, Read by a typed parser in @cq/ledger (TS), not just a prompt-side Read step"]
- recommendation: "Per-REPO `cq.toml` at the repo root, committed, with a single `reviewers = [\"<harness>:<model>\", ...]` list shared across plan- and implement-flow, and the feature OFF (exactly today's single native Claude reviewer) whenever the file or key is absent — so non-opted-in repos are unaffected. Token schema `<harness>:<model>`: `claude:*` → native Agent subagent; `pi:*`/`codex:*` → CLI shellout. Keep it prompt-side (a Read step at the top of the review phase) rather than new TS, unless you want validation; per-flow keys can be a later refinement if a real need appears. This keeps the surface small and the default behaviour identical to today."

- answer: "per-repo cq.toml but we should provide a separate mcp endpoint (cq-config or smth like that). Also, I think we need two things in the config: 1) mapping alias->model name, e.g. aliases=[codex=\"pi:gpt-5.5\", grok=\"pi:grok-build\", opus=\"claude:opus-4.8[1M]\"], and then reviewers=[\"codex\", \"grok\", \"opus\"]"

- question: "FEATURE 2 — the on-the-fly ACTIVE reviewer set: where is the override stored and how long does it persist? cq.toml is the DEFAULT; a `/cq:reviewers use grok and opus only` command changes the ACTIVE set. Since each `/plan:advance` or `/implement:advance` is a FRESH orchestrator session (no in-memory state survives between runs), the active override must live in DURABLE storage the next orchestrator run reads. Where: (i) a gitignored runtime file (e.g. `.cq/active-reviewers` or `cq.local.toml`); (ii) a decisions/config ledger item; or (iii) the override is session-only (the user re-states it each run)? And does `/cq:reviewers` parse natural language ('grok and opus only') into harness:model tokens?"
- context: "This is the subtlest part: 'on the fly' implies the override outlives the single command that set it, but the orchestrators are stateless across invocations (each /plan:advance is a new process). So 'active set' = a durable override the orchestrator reads at review time, falling back to cq.toml's default when absent. A gitignored local file keeps a personal/transient override out of git (so it doesn't get committed by accident) and is trivially Read-able. A ledger item is queryable and provenance-tracked but heavier. The natural-language mapping ('grok and opus only' → [pi:grok-build, claude:opus]) needs a small alias table (grok→pi:grok-build, opus→claude:opus, gpt→pi:gpt-5.5 or codex:gpt-5.5)."
- suggestions: ["Override in a GITIGNORED local file (e.g. cq.local.toml or .cq/active-reviewers); /cq:reviewers writes it, every orchestrator run reads it (falling back to cq.toml); cleared by `/cq:reviewers reset`","Override as a decisions/config ledger item (queryable, provenance-tracked, survives across sessions)","Session-only: the override applies only within the current chained run; the user re-states it each fresh /plan:advance","/cq:reviewers maps natural-language ('grok and opus') to harness:model tokens via a documented alias table"]
- recommendation: "Store the active override in a GITIGNORED local file (e.g. `cq.local.toml`, added to .gitignore) that `/cq:reviewers` writes and every orchestrator run reads at review time, falling back to committed cq.toml's default when the file is absent; add `/cq:reviewers reset` to delete it. Gitignored keeps a transient/personal override from being accidentally committed while still surviving across the stateless orchestrator invocations. `/cq:reviewers` should map natural-language aliases ('grok and opus only') to canonical harness:model tokens via a small documented alias table (grok→pi:grok-build, opus→claude:opus, gpt-5.5→pi:gpt-5.5), and confirm/echo the resulting set. A ledger item is the alternative if you want the override queryable in the TUI; I lean toward the file for simplicity."

The standalone server exposes two tools, get_reviewers ({configured, reviewers:[{harness,model,alias}]}) and get_config ({configured, aliases, reviewers}).

Option (a) bumps the count to 20 and keeps consumer call-sites a 1:1 rename (mcp__cq-config__get_reviewers -> mcp__ledger__get_reviewers). /cq:reviewers calls get_config; plan/implement advance call get_reviewers — so both are in active use today, which argues for porting both."

- question: "PART 1 — Confirm FULL removal (not deprecation) of the standalone cq-config server, and the @cq/config dependency wiring. Removal surface I found: the cqConfigMcp derivation + packages.cq-config-mcp + apps.cq-config-mcp in flake.nix, the cq-config-mcp node-modules FOD fileset/installPhase entries, cqConfigPkg + programs.mcp.servers.cq-config in dev-llm.nix, the 'cq-config' entry in .mcp.json, and the whole packages/cq-config-mcp/ directory. The @cq/config PARSER package stays. Confirm: delete all of that outright (no deprecation shim)? AND — to call @cq/config from inside the ledger MCP — should @cq/config become a workspace dependency of @cq/ledger (the package owning ledgerTools.ts) or of @cq/ledger-mcp?"
- context: The merged tool calls loadConfig/resolveReviewers, so @cq/config must be a runtime dep of whichever package holds the tool handler. ledgerTools.ts lives in @cq/ledger, which argues for adding @cq/config there; but @cq/ledger is the cq-free core library, so wiring it into @cq/ledger-mcp's buildServer (passing a resolved reviewer-config callback into the factory, like readLog is threaded) keeps @cq/ledger config-agnostic. This also drives the flake derivation symlink additions and a FOD-hash refresh.
- suggestions: ["Delete outright; add @cq/config dep to @cq/ledger (tool handler lives in ledgerTools.ts directly)","Delete outright; keep @cq/ledger config-agnostic — thread a config capability from @cq/ledger-mcp into the factory (mirror the readLog capability pattern)","Deprecate the standalone server (leave it, just add the merged tool)"]
- recommendation: Delete outright AND keep @cq/ledger config-agnostic by threading a config capability from @cq/ledger-mcp into the tool factory (mirrors how readLog is already injected only when the store is FS-backed) — preserves the 'cq-free core' boundary the ledger-mcp header advertises.

After consolidating into the ledger MCP, the ledger MCP's --cwd (the repo/ledger root) becomes the config root too. Confirm: cq.toml stays at the repo root with the same [aliases] + top-level reviewers=[] schema (PART 2 only ADDS a sibling planners=[] field), and the env override is fine to drop ($CQ_CONFIG_ROOT) in favor of the ledger MCP's existing --cwd/$LEDGER_ROOT?"
- context: Folding the tool into the ledger MCP means the config root is now the ledger root (same directory in practice). The standalone server had its own $CQ_CONFIG_ROOT env; the ledger MCP uses $LEDGER_ROOT. They normally point at the same repo root, so dropping the separate $CQ_CONFIG_ROOT removes a redundant knob — but confirm there's no setup where cq.toml lives somewhere other than the ledger root.

- question: "PART 2 (CORE) — How should N parallel planners RECONCILE? Reviewers reconcile cleanly (strictest-wins on one verdict + tagged-union of findings) because their outputs are commensurable. N independent PLANS are alternative task DAGs that cannot be unioned — unioning would produce a contradictory/duplicated task set. Pick the reconciliation model: (a) GENERATE-N-then-JUDGE — each planner emits a full candidate plan (as a structured task-DAG, NOT yet written to the ledger); a synthesis/judge step (the orchestrator, or a dedicated plan-synthesizer subagent) then either PICKS the single best candidate or SYNTHESIZES a merged plan, and only THAT one plan is written to the ledger; (b) PRIMARY + ADVISORY — one designated primary planner produces and writes the plan via the ledger tools (today's plan-advance path), the other planners produce ADVISORY critiques of a draft that the primary folds in before finalizing (closer to the existing reviewer loop); (c) something else."
- context: This is the central design decision and gates the whole PART 2 architecture. (a) is powerful but requires defining a portable structured-plan interchange format (so a plan can be emitted WITHOUT writing the ledger, then judged) and a synthesis rubric — substantial new machinery, and it changes plan-advance.md from 'one planner writes the ledger' to 'planners emit candidates, orchestrator picks/merges then writes'. (b) reuses the existing single-writer planner + the proven reviewer-style advisory loop almost verbatim (the 'others' become plan critics), at the cost of not truly exploring divergent DAGs in parallel. The reviewer machinery in plan/advance.md step 2b is the closest existing template, which biases toward (b) for consistency and lower build cost; (a) better matches the literal 'launch all planners in parallel and reconcile their plans' framing.
- suggestions: ["(a) generate-N-then-judge: planners emit candidate DAGs, a synthesis step picks-or-merges one, orchestrator writes only the winner","(b) primary + advisory: one primary planner writes; the rest produce advisory critiques the primary folds in (mirrors the reviewer loop)","(c) hybrid / other — specify"]
- recommendation: (a) generate-N-then-JUDGE with a synthesis step is the truer parallel-planners design and matches the user's 'reconcile their plans' wording; but if minimizing build cost and machinery is preferred, (b) primary+advisory reuses the existing reviewer loop almost verbatim. I lean (a) for fidelity to the goal, with the judge defaulting to PICK-best (synthesis as a later enhancement) to bound initial complexity. Please pick (a) or (b).
- ledgerRefs: ["goals:G18"]
- answer: generate-N-then-judge. judge should not just pick-best, it should check if "not-the-best" planners produces something important and if they did the judge should factor good parts of their plans in, not blindly ignore

- question: "PART 2 — Are non-Claude (pi:*) PLANNERS in scope for the first cut, or are planners Claude-only initially (while reviewers remain claude+pi)? A pi:* planner would have to emit a FULL task-DAG plan via stdout (it cannot call the mcp__ledger__* tools to write the ledger — pi shells out non-interactively per K30). That only works under reconciliation model (a) generate-N-then-judge, where plans are emitted as structured candidates and the orchestrator does ALL ledger writes anyway. Under model (b) primary+advisory, a pi planner could still serve as an advisory critic (stdout JSON, like a pi reviewer), but the PRIMARY writer would need ledger access (Claude-only)."
- context: "Reviewers already support pi:* because they only emit JSON the orchestrator consumes — they never write the ledger. The planner's defining act is WRITING the goal/plan to the ledger via mcp tools, which pi cannot do. So pi-planner feasibility is tightly coupled to the reconciliation-model choice in the previous question: model (a) makes pi planners natural (orchestrator owns all writes); model (b) restricts pi to the advisory-critic role only. This answer should be consistent with that one."

- context: Precise relocation boundary + whether dropping ledger-mcp --reset is an acceptable breaking change for consumers. The library method must stay (the MCP/web servers' init path is unrelated to it; reset is operator-only).
- suggestions: ["Keep library reset(); move CLI wrapper to `cq reset`; REMOVE ledger-mcp --reset entirely (breaking CLI change, acceptable)","Keep library reset(); add `cq reset`; KEEP ledger-mcp --reset too (no removal — not really 'relocating')","Move runReset() into a shared module both cq and (optionally) ledger-mcp import, but only `cq` exposes the subcommand"]
- recommendation: Keep FsLedgerStore.reset() in @cq/ledger; move the runReset/ResetIo CLI wrapper into `cq reset`; REMOVE `--reset`/`--yes` from the ledger-mcp binary (breaking but matches 'move OUT of the MCP'). Reuse the same confirmation policy (--yes / TTY prompt / non-TTY refuse).

- question: "FEATURE 2 — define `cq init`, `cq reset`, `cq erase` so the three are non-overlapping, and pin `erase`'s exact scope + safety. Grounded meanings: init = create empty ledgers ONLY if absent (run FsLedgerStore.init(); idempotent; do NOT touch existing data); reset = backup-then-reinit-empty (existing FsLedgerStore.reset(), data recoverable in docs/.backup/); erase = DESTROY with NO backup/reinit. erase has NO existing implementation — what EXACTLY should it delete: (a) only the canonical docs/*.md ledger files + docs/ledgers.yaml, (b) the whole docs/ dir including archive/, .backup/, logs/, .locks/, or (c) docs/*.md + ledgers.yaml + archive/ but PRESERVE .backup/ and logs/? After erase, leave the dir empty or not recreate anything? And what confirmation/safety does each destructive command need?"
- context: init/reset are grounded in existing code; erase is net-new and the most destructive, so its blast radius (esp. whether it nukes the .backup/ safety net and session logs) and confirmation policy must be pinned. Reusing the ResetIo confirmation pattern (--yes / TTY prompt / non-TTY refuse) is the natural safety model.
- suggestions: ["init=init()-if-none; reset=backup+reinit (existing); erase=delete docs/*.md + ledgers.yaml + archive/, PRESERVE docs/.backup/ + docs/logs/, leave empty; all destructive cmds require --yes or TTY confirm, non-TTY refuse","erase nukes the ENTIRE docs/ tree (incl. .backup/ + logs/ + .locks/) — a true clean slate","erase deletes only docs/*.md + ledgers.yaml (active ledgers), preserving archive/ + .backup/ + logs/"]
- recommendation: "init = init()-if-none (idempotent, never overwrites); reset = existing backup+reinit; erase = destroy the active ledgers + registry + archive/ but PRESERVE docs/.backup/ and docs/logs/ (don't destroy the safety net / session history), leave nothing re-initialised. Every destructive command (reset, erase) reuses the ResetIo policy: --yes to proceed, TTY prompt otherwise, non-TTY-without-yes REFUSES."
- answer: as recommended but erase should erase everything including archives and config

- question: "COORDINATION with in-flight G18: G20's [webui] parsing touches the SAME @cq/config parser files (toml.ts/config.ts/types.ts) that G18 PART 2 (status: planned, not yet built) is extending for `planners`. How should these be sequenced? Options: (a) G20 plans against current HEAD and accepts a rebase/merge if G18 lands first; (b) G20 depends on / waits for G18 to land; (c) build them together. Also: should `cq init` create the cq.toml file itself (a starter [webui]/[aliases]/reviewers/planners template), or does `cq init` ONLY bootstrap the docs/ ledgers and leave cq.toml entirely to the user?"
- context: Both goals edit the same minimal TOML parser; conflicting edits to the table-whitelist + CqConfig shape are likely. Also need to decide whether cq.toml authoring is in scope for `cq init` at all.
- suggestions: ["G20 plans against HEAD, sequence parser edits after G18 if it lands first (dependsOn note); cq init does NOT write cq.toml","G20 explicitly depends on G18 landing first; cq init does NOT write cq.toml","cq init ALSO scaffolds a starter cq.toml with a commented [webui] template"]
- recommendation: (a) Plan G20 against current HEAD and coordinate parser edits with G18 (serialize same-file changes if G18 lands first); `cq init` bootstraps ONLY the docs/ ledgers and does NOT write cq.toml (config authoring stays the user's, consistent with loadConfig returning null when absent).
- answer: G20 explicitly depends on G18 landing first; cq init does NOT write cq.toml

- question: Where should the phase-1 state-machine DOCUMENT live, and in what form? The flows are currently described implicitly across the command specs in nix/pkg/cq-assets/commands/cq/. Phase 2 (the Flows tab) needs a structured source it can render from, so the document's format determines whether the doc and the tab share one source of truth.
- context: The existing 'State machines' tab is data-driven (computeStateMachine reads schema.statusValues + schema.transitions). The flow orchestration state machines are NOT in any ledger schema — they live only as prose in the markdown command specs. So phase 1 must define an authoritative description that phase 2 can consume. I can default to authoring it, but the LOCATION and FORM are a deliverable choice that affects both phases.
- suggestions: ["A single prose Markdown doc under nix/pkg/cq-assets/docs/ (or ./docs/) describing each flow's states+transitions, kept separate from the tab's render data","A structured data file (TS/JSON) of states+edges that BOTH the document generator and the Flows tab consume — single source of truth, doc rendered from it","A prose doc for humans PLUS a separate hand-authored TS data module for the tab (two artifacts, kept in sync manually)"]
- recommendation: Single structured TS data module (states+edges per flow, plus cross-flow handoff edges) as the source of truth, co-located with the web package; the phase-1 'document' is that module plus a short prose Markdown overview rendered/derived from it. This keeps the tab and the doc from drifting.
- ledgerRefs: ["goals:G23"]
- answer: A single prose Markdown doc under nix/pkg/cq-assets/docs/ (or ./docs/) describing each flow's states+transitions, kept separate from the tab's render data

- question: "What diagram granularity should the Flows tab render: one diagram per flow (plan / investigate / implement / advance), a single combined diagram showing all flows plus their cross-flow handoffs, or both?"
- context: The goal stresses that flows 'perform a handoff and return back to an original/parent state' (e.g. advance sequences plan->investigate->implement; plan file-and-defers a confirmed defect to investigate; investigate seeds a goal back to plan). Per-flow diagrams keep each readable but hide the handoff topology; a combined diagram shows handoffs but is denser. This changes the data model and the layout work in phase 2.
- suggestions: ["One diagram per flow (4 separate state machines), with handoffs shown as labelled exit/entry edges to named external states","A single combined diagram: all flow states in one graph with explicit cross-flow handoff edges","Both: per-flow diagrams as the primary view, plus one top-level 'advance sequencer' overview diagram showing the handoff topology"]
- recommendation: Both — per-flow diagrams (one each for plan, investigate, implement) plus a top-level advance-sequencer overview that shows the handoff topology between them. The advance flow is inherently the cross-flow view, so it doubles as the combined diagram.

- question: Should the Flows tab REUSE the existing diagram renderer (computeDagLayout + the SVG state-machine renderer used by the 'State machines' tab), or do the flow diagrams need features the current renderer lacks (edge labels, self-loops, distinct node shapes for waiting-for-input vs handoff states, subgraph grouping)?
- context: computeStateMachine/computeDagLayout produce a left->right layered layout with straight unlabelled edges and uniform boxes; the layout is cycle-tolerant but drops self-loops (e.g. an orchestrator 'loop until quiescent' edge) and renders no edge labels. Flow state machines centrally feature loops, self-transitions, labelled transitions ('user answers' / 'go-ahead' / 'handoff'), and a distinguished waiting-for-user-input state. Whether these are required determines if phase 2 extends the renderer or just feeds new data into it.
- suggestions: ["Reuse the renderer as-is; accept unlabelled straight edges and no self-loops (model loops as edges between distinct named states)","Extend the shared renderer with edge labels + self-loop rendering, benefiting both tabs","Build a dedicated flow renderer for the Flows tab, leaving the State-machines renderer untouched"]
- recommendation: Extend the shared renderer minimally to support edge labels and self-loops (both are genuinely needed to express flow loops and labelled transitions faithfully), and reuse it for the Flows tab. Avoid a second renderer unless the layout needs diverge substantially.
- ledgerRefs: ["goals:G23"]
- answer: I think you should try to find a good graph/diagram/state machine visualization library and use it for both tabs instead of continuing maintenance of our homegrown renderer

- question: Does "retire" mean these four skills must no longer be installed/registered as invocable at all, or merely relocated out of the active source tree while references are scrubbed?
- context: "The four skills live as directories under nix/pkg/llm-skills/skills/{research-loop,vsm-loop,vsm-node,question-batch}/, each a {meta.yaml,content.md} pair. llm-skills/default.nix auto-discovers skills via `builtins.readDir ./skills` — a directory's mere PRESENCE under skills/ IS its registration into the merged skill set that home-manager installs for Claude/Codex/Pi. So physically MOVING each skill dir to ./docs/legacy-skills (your stated request) automatically de-registers it from the Nix build with no manifest edit — relocation and de-registration are the same act here. This question confirms that is the intent (vs. wanting them kept registered but moved, which is not achievable given how readDir works — they'd have to stay under skills/)."
- suggestions: ["Fully retire: move the dirs out of nix/pkg/llm-skills/skills/ to ./docs/legacy-skills, which de-registers them from the build — they are no longer installed/invocable.","Keep registered but relocate elsewhere (NOT possible with current readDir auto-discovery without also keeping them under skills/)."]
- recommendation: Fully retire — move the four skill dirs out of nix/pkg/llm-skills/skills/ to ./docs/legacy-skills, which both archives the source and de-registers them from the installed skill set.

- question: "For \"clean up the references\" in the cq flow: should each reference to a retired skill be DELETED outright, or REPOINTED to its surviving cq-flow successor where one exists?"
- context: "The four legacy skills appear superseded by the cq flow, so most references read as vestigial mentions rather than runtime calls: (a) question-batch — the cq flow files clarifying questions directly as `questions` ledger items (this plan-advance agent does exactly that; cq/plan.md routes clarification through the planner, not question-batch), so its successor is the questions-ledger mechanism; (b) research-loop — overlapped by /cq:investigate(:advance) (defect intake + hypothesis-tree investigation); (c) vsm-loop / vsm-node — the meta-orchestration layer, broadly superseded by the /cq:advance + plan/implement/investigate flow. Whether a stray mention should be dropped vs. rewritten to name the cq successor changes every edit in the plan."
- suggestions: ["Delete all references outright (simplest; leaves no pointer).","Repoint to the cq successor where one clearly exists (question-batch→questions ledger, research-loop→/cq:investigate, vsm→/cq:advance flow), delete only where no successor applies.","Per-skill decision (e.g. repoint research-loop→investigate, but just delete vsm mentions)."]

- question: "In ./docs/legacy-skills, what form should each archived skill take — keep the original {meta.yaml, content.md} directory structure verbatim, or flatten into a single plain Markdown file per skill?"
- context: "Today each skill is a directory with meta.yaml (front-matter: name + description/TRIGGER) plus content.md (the body). ./docs/legacy-skills is repo-root relative and does not yet exist (docs/ holds logs/, archive/, drafts/, etc.). Keeping the dir structure preserves the exact source for possible future revival; flattening to one .md (e.g. docs/legacy-skills/research-loop.md with the meta folded in as a header) is tidier for pure archival reading. This decides the move's target layout. Note: the skills cross-reference each other and review-loop via [[wikilinks]] (e.g. vsm-loop links research-loop, vsm-node, AND review-loop which is NOT being retired) — whatever layout, those intra-archive links and the link to the surviving review-loop skill will need handling."

- question: review-loop is NOT in the retirement list but is tightly coupled to the retired skills (vsm-loop composes it; vsm-node and the legacy skills cross-link it). Is review-loop deliberately KEPT, and is the retirement list exactly these four (no other skills/docs follow)?
- context: "vsm-loop's body explicitly composes [[review-loop]] for build cycles and [[research-loop]] for investigation; vsm-node is review-loop's recursion contract. Retiring research-loop/vsm-loop/vsm-node leaves review-loop as a survivor that references now-archived peers, and review-loop itself is arguably superseded by the cq plan/implement/review flow too. I want to confirm the boundary is exactly {research-loop, vsm-loop, vsm-node, question-batch} and that review-loop (and any other skill or doc) stays put — so the plan scopes the reference cleanup correctly and doesn't accidentally leave or break review-loop's links."

- question: The popup already exists — is the actual ask just to render its content as markdown? In ledger-web, clicking a sessionLogs entry already opens a modal (SessionLogsPanel + LogModal, T152/Q87) that fetches the log via the read_log MCP tool. The ONLY gap vs. your request is that LogModal renders the content in a verbatim <pre> (lw-log-content) instead of through the existing Markdown component. Is the scope of this goal precisely "render the log content in the existing popup as rendered markdown (react-markdown/remark-gfm/rehype-sanitize) instead of preformatted text", or did you intend a larger change (e.g. a different/new popup, currently-unobserved inline rendering elsewhere)?
- context: App.tsx already has SessionLogsPanel (links) -> LogModal (popup) -> client.readLog -> read_log tool. LogModal body uses <pre className="lw-log-content"> at the content line, not <Markdown>. The Markdown component (react-markdown + remark-gfm + rehype-sanitize) already exists and is used for other fields. So 'open popups for the logs' appears already done; 'render as markdown' is the unmet part. Confirming this pins the whole task to a small, surgical change.
- suggestions: ["Yes — scope is exactly: render log content as markdown inside the existing LogModal popup (swap the <pre> for the Markdown component); nothing else","No — there is still verbatim INLINE rendering somewhere I'm seeing; please investigate that specific view first","Broader — I want a redesigned/different log viewer, not just markdown in the current modal"]
- recommendation: Yes — render log content as markdown inside the existing popup; treat the rest (links, modal, read_log fetch) as already done.
- ledgerRefs: ["goals:G26"]
- answer: I press goals, select a goal, click on a session log button - the log opens inline, not as a popup. I need it to open as a popup and the content to be rendered as markdown

- question: "Which frontend(s) are in scope — ledger-web only, or ledger-tui too? The popup/markdown rendering described is a ledger-web (React) concept. ledger-tui (ink terminal UI) currently has NO log-content rendering at all: its LedgerClient does not even expose readLog, and a terminal UI has no modal/markdown renderer. Do you want this goal limited to ledger-web, or should ledger-tui also gain some form of log viewing (which would be a substantially larger, separate effort)?"
- context: "ledger-web: full read_log/readLog/Markdown/modal infra exists. ledger-tui/src/mcpClient.ts LedgerClient import list has no ReadLogResult/readLog; the TUI shows sessionLogs (if at all) only as plain path strings. 'Popup' has no terminal analogue."

- question: Which items/fields does the popup apply to? You named goals/handoffs, but the SessionLogsPanel renders the `sessionLogs` field for ANY selected item that has it (the panel is wired generically in DetailPanel for every non-draft item with onReadLog). Other ledgers (tasks, reviews, defects) can also carry sessionLogs. Should the markdown-popup behavior apply to the sessionLogs field on ALL ledger items uniformly (current behavior), or be restricted to goals + handoffs specifically? And does this concern ONLY the sessionLogs field, or also other markdown fields?
- context: "DetailPanel renders <SessionLogsPanel item={row.item} onReadLog=...> for every non-draft item when onReadLog is provided, keyed off fields.sessionLogs. It is not goals/handoffs-specific today. Restricting it would be a deliberate narrowing."
- suggestions: ["All items with a sessionLogs field, uniformly (keep current generic wiring; only the markdown rendering changes)","Restrict to goals + handoffs only","sessionLogs only (do not touch other markdown fields)"]

- question: "Two presentation details for the markdown-in-popup rendering: (a) When a log file is large, the server truncates it (read_log returns truncated:true) and LogModal currently shows a '(log truncated…)' notice above a <pre>. With markdown rendering, should we keep that truncation notice and render the (possibly truncated) content as markdown? (b) Do you want a raw/verbatim fallback toggle (view rendered markdown vs. raw text) in the popup, or is rendered-markdown-only sufficient?"
- context: LogModal already handles loading/error/truncated states and renders content in <pre>. Truncated markdown can render imperfectly (e.g. an unclosed code fence), which is the main edge case for switching <pre> -> Markdown. A raw toggle is optional polish.
- suggestions: ["Keep the truncation notice; render content as markdown; no raw toggle (simplest)","Keep truncation notice AND add a 'raw / rendered' toggle in the popup","Rendered markdown only; drop the truncation notice"]
