/**
 * FsLedgerStore — filesystem-backed implementation of `LedgerStore`.
 *
 * It is the {@link AbstractLedgerStore} base (which holds ALL the shared,
 * persistence-agnostic machinery — the in-memory map, parse/serialize, FTS, the
 * mutex, the lockfile critical sections, schema-divergence DETECTION + reinit
 * orchestration, and every read/mutation method) wired to an {@link FsPersistence}
 * byte-I/O seam plus the filesystem-only concerns the base does not own:
 *   - the advisory lockfile root (`docs/.locks`);
 *   - the `~/.cache` mirror (cacheMirror.ts) fired after every mutation;
 *   - the FS-only `read_log` capability (T147 / Q87);
 *   - the operator-facing `reset()` wipe-and-reinit (+ `ResetSummary`);
 *   - the `rootDir` accessor a host binds root-scoped config to.
 *
 * Layout under `root` (typically the server's --cwd):
 *   ./docs/ledgers.yaml                              # central registry
 *   ./docs/<ledger>.md                               # active ledger
 *   ./docs/archive/<ledger>/<milestone-id>.md        # archived group (or item, for milestones ledger)
 *   ./docs/.locks/<ledger>.lock                      # advisory lockfile
 *   ./docs/.locks/__milestones__.lock                # global milestones lock
 *
 * Lock discipline (msunify cycle):
 *   - Per-ledger AsyncMutex + lockfile for within-ledger ops.
 *   - Global `__milestones__` AsyncMutex + lockfile for operations that
 *     mutate the milestones ledger OR create/archive items referencing it.
 *   - Multi-lock acquisition order: `__milestones__` first; then per-ledger
 *     locks in alphabetic order. This contract MUST hold for every
 *     multi-lock path to avoid cyclic deadlock.
