Loop then drained the build's own follow-up defects: G13 fixed D25 (stale eslint-disable), D26 (readLog symlink-escape hardening), D27 (handoff trigger wording) [M48 archived]; G14 fixed D28 (readLog check-then-read TOCTOU) [M50 archived].

Pre-existing M11 left un-archived (dangling open hypothesis H3 under resolved D2). NOTE: a later patch (6aa066b) hardened the stop into a progress-bounded gate after a user-flagged unwarranted stop earlier in the run."

    /advance run (resumed after the user answered Q97-Q102 and flagged the D31 regression) reached quiescence: MIXED — the entire G18 feature landed + D32 auto-fixed end-to-end; only pre-existing D31 remains blocked on open Q103.
    
    LANDED — G18 'Merge cq-config into ledger MCP + pluggable parallel planners', BOTH parts fully BUILT and merged to main (tip 418b641):
    • PART 1 (M61 archived) — 11 tasks (T1-T11): get_reviewers+get_config merged onto BOTH ledger-MCP tool surfaces behind an injected config-agnostic ConfigCapability (T1) wired through buildServer + e2e stdio roundtrip (T2); tool-count 18→20 + cross-surface drift-guard (T3); standalone @cq/config-mcp server package DELETED (T4); flake.nix cqConfigMcp derivation/attrs/FOD removed + @cq/config symlink into ledger-mcp & embed closures (T5); dev-llm.nix (T6) + .mcp.json (T7) registrations removed; the 3 consumer commands repointed mcp__cq-config__* → mcp__ledger__* (T8/T9/T10); node-modules FOD hash refreshed + nix build .#ledger-mcp/.#ledger-tui/.#ledger-web all green + .#cq-config-mcp now attr-not-found (T11). The @cq/config PARSER library was retained.
    • PART 2 (M62 archived) — 6 tasks (T12-T17): planners=[] added to @cq/config (resolvePlanners, shared [aliases]) (T12); get_planners tool + planners-on-get_config on BOTH surfaces, count 20→21 + drift-guard + e2e stdio (T13); plan-advance CANDIDATE mode emitting task-DAG JSON (T14); multi-planner generate-N-then-JUDGE+SYNTHESIS step in plan/advance.md — candidate-emitters (claude CANDIDATE mode + pi K30 shellout), judge folds in non-best, orchestrator owns all ledger writes (T15); commands/cq/planners.md session-only override mirroring reviewers.md (T16); convergence gate — assets glob auto-includes planners.md, cq.toml.example planners= example, mcp__cq-config__ grep clean (T17). Reviews R195-R211 go-ahead (T3/T9/T12/T13 each after one autonomous criticism round). bun run check green 931/0.
    • D32 (out-of-scope defect filed by T10's reviewer: cq-assets/README.md still documented the removed cq-config server) auto-investigated→root-caused (H23, validated against source)→defect-seeded goal G19 (M63)→planned (K32, review R212)→BUILT (T182, R213, commit 418b641)→D32 RESOLVED, M64 archived; traceability Q104 withdrawn. README 'Configuration' section repointed to the ledger MCP.
    
    BLOCKED — D31 (web BatchAnswerModal premature-close) remains `inconclusive`: it does NOT reproduce from current source (a passing test asserts correct advance-on-non-last-answer) and is parked on open Q103 awaiting the user's exact repro / which build they observed. Pre-existing from the prior turn; orthogonal to G18.
    
    Gate at stop: P-investigate=FALSE, P-plan=FALSE, P-implement=FALSE; only Q103 open (gating D31). Goals G10-G19 are all `planned` with their work milestones archived — READY FOR THE USER TO CLOSE (set status `done`; goals never auto-close). Coordination milestones M37/M39/M40/M47/M49/M51/M53/M57/M59/M63 stay open until their goals are closed; M11/M60 (investigate) and M-AMBIENT likewise remain. NEXT: answer Q103 in the TUI/web to unblock D31 (or close it if the regression isn't observed on a fresh build), and close the planned goals; then re-run /advance if anything new appears.

Investigate stage: H22 (suspected T163 regression) ruled WRONG; H24 CONFIRMED (validated against source) — the modal backdrop closed on any click whose common-ancestor was the backdrop, with NO guard the press STARTED there; a press-and-hold on 'save & mark answered' (HOLD_MS timer-fired) advanced to a shorter question, the content-driven dialog shrank WHILE still pressed, and the release over the backdrop dismissed it (react-modal #466 class; the suite was green only because no test clicked the backdrop — vacuous coverage cf. D24/H14). The SAME pattern existed in 2 other overlays (help, log). Defect-seeded G21→planned (K33/R214)→BUILT: T183 (reproduce-first RED happy-dom test) + T184 (shared useBackdropDismiss hook closing only when target===currentTarget on BOTH pointerdown/mousedown and click, applied to all 3 overlays). D31 RESOLVED; M60+M67 archived.
    • G20 (the user's 2 feature requests) — clarified (Q105–Q111 answered), planned (K34; one plan revise round R215→R216 fixed a same-file cq-cli/main.ts collision + FOD-edge + the ledger-web @cq/config wiring), and fully BUILT across 8 tasks: FEATURE 1 (M68) — swapped the hand-rolled @cq/config TOML parser to smol-toml + typed [webui] (host string / integer port) (T185); per-field host/port resolution CLI>cq.toml>default + bounded always-on port auto-increment (T186); ledger-web main() loads cq.toml, scans for a free port, reports the ACTUAL bound URL to STDOUT (T187). FEATURE 2 (M69) — new `cq` CLI package: `cq init` (idempotent), `cq reset` (relocated off ledger-mcp — --reset REMOVED there, a deliberate breaking CLI change), `cq erase` (net-new bounded irreversible destroy of docs/+cq.toml), Nix-packaged (.#cq) with a consolidated node-modules FOD-hash refresh (T188–T192). M68+M69 archived.
    
    Gate at stop: P-investigate=FALSE (all defects resolved), P-plan=FALSE (all goals locked/planned), P-implement=FALSE (all tasks done/archived), no open questions. READY FOR THE USER TO CLOSE (goals never auto-close): G20 + G21 (this run) and the pre-existing planned G10–G19 — set each `done` in the TUI/web; their coordination milestones (M65/M66 + the older ones) auto-archive on the next /advance sweep. NOTE: a tiny non-blocking nit — the @cq/config symlink under the new cqCli derivation is unused dead weight (cq-cli has no @cq/config dep); harmless, optional cleanup. No user action REQUIRED to proceed; the run is complete.

- summary: "/plan:start bootstrapped goal G22 (milestone M70) — four pre-large-project requests: (1) reorder the ledger-web left sidebar into the requested grouped order with splitters; (2) give the help popup a large CONSTANT size so it doesn't jump between tabs; (3) left-align the generated state-machine SVG diagrams; (4) rename the entry commands under cq: (/advance→cq:advance, /plan:start→cq:plan, /investigate:start→cq:investigate; the *:advance + *:follow-up names stay). Per the user's 'avoid obvious questions' directive, the planner found NOTHING genuinely ambiguous, FILED NO clarifying questions, and emitted the plan directly; it was then reviewed (one revise round R227→R228 closed a T196/T198 cross-file-rename coverage gap) and LOCKED (decision K35). G22 is `planned`, NOT awaiting any user input. Plan = M71 (web UI, parts 1-3): T193 sidebar reorder → T194 help fixed-size → T195 SVG left-align (serialized on App.tsx/styles.css); M72 (renames, part 4): T196 relocate the 3 command files + rewrite all renamed-from refs within them → T197 link-prompts.ts LINKS → T198 repo-wide cross-ref + README sweep (excluding the 3 relocated files). Key grounding: sidebar order is hardcoded in App.tsx visualLedgers.map (Q&A = the batch-answer trigger button, not a ledger); the SVGs are generated (fix = preserveAspectRatio xMinYMid + uniform width); command keys are pure directory-tree-derived so relocating files suffices (no assets.nix/dev-llm.nix edit); old command names removed outright (no aliases). NO blocking questions. NEXT: run `/advance` (or `/implement:advance`) to BUILD G22 — no user action is required first; the plan is locked and ready."

- summary: |
    /cq:advance run delivered a large verified increment, then stopped on a tooling impediment to autonomous continuation of the dependency-chained remainder (NOT a defect in the landed work). LANDED + MERGED (commit e9bf762, ledger 5af798f): (1) D33 root-caused via headless-chromium ground truth — the wide state-machine diagrams' right-shift was computeDagLayout leaving layer 0 empty for fully-cyclic status graphs, NOT the CSS (both prior CSS attempts correctly failed) — and FIXED (T199, layer re-base + 11 pure unit tests, reviewed go-ahead); D33 resolved; M73+M76 archived. (2) G23 planned+approved (elkjs adoption, K37 locked) and its first two tasks done: T200 flow-state-machine doc (nix/pkg/cq-assets/docs/flow-state-machines.md), T201 elkjs 0.11.1 wired through the Nix FOD + bundle (both nix builds green). bun run check green throughout.
    
    STOP CAUSE (illness = impediment, not a code defect): the remaining G23 tasks T202->T203->T204->T205->T206 are a strict dependency chain (T202 elk adapter/renderer needs T201's merged elkjs; T203 migrate State-machines tab needs T202; etc.). The Agent worktree-isolation base was observed pinned to the SESSION-START commit 224f69f (for all three workers this run, even after main advanced), so a worker dispatched now for T202 would get a worktree WITHOUT the merged elkjs/T199 code and could not implement correctly. Combined with single-session scope, autonomous continuation of the chain is not reliable this session.
    
    RESUMPTION: re-run /cq:advance in a FRESH session — its worktrees will branch from the updated main (5af798f, which includes elkjs + the layout fix), so T202-T206 will see their dependencies. The ledger is fully consistent (git + ledger aligned); the run is idempotent/resumable. P-implement is TRUE (T202 ready), P-investigate/P-plan FALSE, no open questions.
    
    ALSO: G24 (D33 fix) is building with all work done and M76 archived -> READY FOR USER TO CLOSE (goals never auto-close). G23 is building with T202-T206 remaining.

- summary: |
    /cq:advance (continuation run) advanced G23's implement chain by one more task, then stopped at the session's practical context limit (NOT a code defect; the landed work is verified-good). LANDED THIS RUN (commit 599948c, ledger fd06a27): T202 — the shared elk-based layout layer (src/diagramLayout.ts async layered layout with self-loops + edge labels; src/DiagramSvg.tsx generic thin SVG renderer with the parameterised data-testid scheme; diagramLayout.test.ts). Reviewer raised one doc-comment criticism (self-contradictory testid example) which was addressed in the merge commit; bun run check green (998 pass/0 fail). User CONFIRMED D33's fix renders correctly in their deploy.
    
    REMAINING (ready, resumable): T203 (migrate the State-machines tab onto DiagramSvg, retire homegrown layout for that tab; add the new happy-dom render test + left-align/D33 reconciliation) and T204 (flow render-data module) are BOTH DAG-ready now (deps T200+T202 done); then T205 (Flows tab UI, deps T203+T204) and T206 (e2e verification incl. headless-chromium). These form the remainder of the elkjs migration + the new Flows tab.
    
    STOP CAUSE: single-session context budget exhausted — cannot run the remaining 4 worker+reviewer+merge cycles without risking a mid-cycle inconsistent ledger/tree. Also note the Agent worktree-isolation base remains pinned to the session-start commit 224f69f even on no-isolation dispatch (the T202 worker had to `git reset --hard f1411d7`); the implement-worker handled it, but a FRESH /cq:advance session (worktrees branching from the updated main, currently fd06a27) is the clean way to continue.
    
    P-investigate=FALSE, P-plan=FALSE, P-implement=TRUE (T203/T204 ready), open-Q-gate=none. Ledger + git are fully consistent; the run is idempotent/resumable via /cq:advance in a fresh session. Also: G24 (D33 fix) is building with all work done + M76 archived — READY FOR USER TO CLOSE.

The ONLY real gap is LogModal renders content in a verbatim <pre className=lw-log-content> (App.tsx ~L3148) instead of the existing Markdown component (src/Markdown.tsx). All infra present (read_log, client.readLog, Markdown, useBackdropDismiss, lw-modal* CSS); no new MCP tool needed; panel already generic across any item with sessionLogs. ledger-tui has no log-content rendering at all.
