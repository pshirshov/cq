description: Advance plan-flow goals one full round — a given goal, or (no argument) every unlocked goal — running the planner↔reviewer loop until each needs the user or reaches `planned`.

You are the **thin orchestrator** for the plan-flow advance loop. The argument
(may be empty) is:

> $ARGUMENTS

Subagents cannot spawn other subagents, so the planner↔reviewer LOOP lives here
in the main session. During the **primary planning round** the `plan-advance`
subagent makes every goal/plan state change. The **review** step is pluggable
(step 2): in the **single-reviewer fallback** the native `plan-reviewer`
subagent writes the one review itself (you write nothing); in the **configured
multi-reviewer** path you, the orchestrator, write the SINGLE aggregated
`reviews` item that reconciles all reviewers' verdicts (the native reviewers
return JSON and write nothing). Your job is to drive that loop, then run the
**auto-investigate phase** (below) on any defects the round filed, and relay the
outcome.

> The auto-investigate phase runs `/investigate:advance` **inline** (per K12 —
> a *command* may chain another command; a *subagent* still cannot). That phase,
> following llm/commands/investigate/advance.md, writes the ledger (the
> investigate loop's own writes), and the broadened `allowed-tools`
> (`mcp__ledger__*`, `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob`) supports it. The only OTHER ledger
> write you make is the configured-mode aggregated `reviews` item (step 2b-iii);
> the single-reviewer fallback round stays read-only-to-you.

## Select the target goal(s)

- **`$ARGUMENTS` is a goal id** → the target set is just that one goal.
- **`$ARGUMENTS` is empty** → advance ALL **unlocked** goals: read the goals
  ledger (`fetch_ledger("goals")`) and take every goal whose phase is
  `clarifying` or `planning` (NOT `planned`, `building`, `done`, or
  `abandoned` — those are locked/terminal for planning). If none qualify, report
  "no unlocked goals" and stop.

Run **the per-goal round below independently for EACH** target goal **G**. Treat
goals independently: one that stops at `awaiting-answers` is recorded and the
next goal still runs. After the per-goal planning round, run the
**auto-investigate phase** (below) on the defects that round filed. Then give the
per-goal report.

## The per-goal round (for one goal G)

Loop the planner↔reviewer steps below until the planner returns a terminal token
(`awaiting-answers` / `completed` / `noop`). There is **NO hard iteration cap** —
the loop is bounded by the planner's state machine (it advances ONE step per
call toward a terminal phase) and, for the cross-command auto-investigate↔replan
axis, by the **concrete stop predicates** in the auto-investigate phase (cite
**K12**, which supersedes K8 pt3 and removed the former 4-iteration cap):

1. **Spawn the planner.** Use the `Agent` tool with
   `subagent_type: "plan-advance"`, passing the goal id (`$ARGUMENTS`) in the
   prompt. It performs EXACTLY ONE state-driven step against the goal and
   returns a single status token:
   - `awaiting-answers` — it filed (or left) `open` questions; the user must
     answer them. **Stop the loop.**
   - `review-requested` — it emitted or revised a plan. **Run the reviewer**
     (step 2), then continue the loop.
   - `completed` — the goal reached `planned` (plan locked), or was already in a
     post-planning phase (`building`/`done`) when the planner ran (no further
     planning step possible). **Stop.** The planner never auto-closes a goal to
     `done`; `building→done` is always the user's action.
   - `noop` — nothing to do in the current state. **Stop.**

2. **Review the plan** (only on `review-requested`). The review step is
   **pluggable**: a configurable set of reviewers may judge the plan in parallel
   and have their verdicts reconciled into ONE `reviews` item. Resolve which
   reviewers run, run them, reconcile, then continue the loop.

   1. **Resolve the active reviewer set.** Call the `cq-config` MCP
      `get_reviewers` tool (registered in `.mcp.json`; returns
      `{ configured: boolean, reviewers: [{ harness, model, alias }] }`,
      `harness` ∈ {`claude`, `pi`}).
      - If the tool is **absent** (server not registered) or it returns
        `configured: false` (no `cq.toml`), take the **single-reviewer
        fallback** (sub-step 2a).
      - If it returns `configured: true`, take the **multi-reviewer path**
        (sub-step 2b), AND honor any **session-only reviewer override** the user
        stated this run via `/cq:reviewers` (T177): an in-memory override
        supersedes the `cq.toml` default for THIS run only (it is never
        persisted) — use the overridden active set in place of `get_reviewers`'
        `reviewers` when one is in effect.

   2a. **Single-reviewer fallback** (unconfigured / tool absent — UNCHANGED
      behaviour). Use the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: "plan-reviewer"`,
      passing the goal id. In this mode the native `plan-reviewer` (T173) runs in
      its **fallback mode** and WRITES the verdict item into the `reviews` ledger
      itself (`go-ahead` or `revise`) — exactly today's path; the orchestrator
      writes NO reviews item. It returns a one-line pointer to the review id.
      Then go to **sub-step 2c** (continue the loop). EXACTLY ONE `reviews` item
      is written this round (by the reviewer).

   2b. **Multi-reviewer path** (configured). Launch ALL active reviewers **in
      parallel** and collect each one's verdict JSON. In this mode NO reviewer
      writes the ledger — the orchestrator writes the single aggregated item
      (sub-step 2b-iii).
      - **i. Per-reviewer launch.** For each active reviewer token:
        - `claude:<model>` → an `Agent` tool call with
          `subagent_type: "plan-reviewer"`, passing the goal id AND instructing
          it to run in **configured mode** per T173: it RETURNS its verdict JSON
          and writes **NOTHING** to the `reviews` ledger (in configured mode the
          native reviewer is one of several, so it never writes — the only
          ledger writer is the orchestrator, sub-step 2b-iii). Capture the
          returned `{ summary, verdict, new_questions, criticism, defects }`.
        - `pi:<model>` → shell out via `Bash` to the `pi` CLI using the
          confirmed **non-interactive** invocation from the **T169 spike (K30)**:
          `pi -p --no-tools --no-session --provider <P> --model <M> '<prompt>'`
          (the combined `--model <P>/<M>` form also works; default
          `--mode text` emits the bare reply on stdout). Concrete provider/model
          pairs from K30: grok-build → `--provider grok-build --model grok-build`;
          gpt-5.5 → `--provider openai-codex --model gpt-5.5`. Both providers are
          OAuth-pre-authenticated. Feed it the **shared `/cq:plan-review` rubric
          prompt** (`commands/cq/plan-review.md`, T173) plus the goal/plan
          context (the goal's title/description/grounding, its Q&A history, and
          the emitted work-milestone tasks — the same material the native
          reviewer reads). Its stdout-json contract is the rubric's:
          `{ summary, verdict: "go-ahead"|"revise", new_questions: [],
          criticism: [], defects: [...] }`. **Strip any code fence** before
          parsing — `pi` may wrap the JSON in a triple-backtick ` ```json `
          block. Capture the parsed object.
      - **ii. Reconcile (Q91) — STRICTEST-WINS + tagged UNION.** Combine all
        reviewers' verdicts into one:
        - **Verdict:** `revise` if ANY reviewer returned `revise`; `go-ahead`
          ONLY if ALL reviewers returned `go-ahead`.
        - **Findings:** UNION every reviewer's `new_questions`, `criticism`, and
          `defects`. **Prefix each finding with its source reviewer's alias**
          (e.g. `[grok] …`, `[opus] …`) so provenance survives the merge.
          De-duplicate obvious near-identical findings across reviewers, but bias
          to KEEP — when in doubt, retain both. (For `defects` objects, tag the
          `headline`.)
      - **iii. Orchestrator writes the ONE aggregated `reviews` item.** YOU (the
        orchestrator), not any reviewer, write the single reconciled verdict:
        `create_item("reviews", M, status: <reconciled verdict>, fields: {
        summary: "<one-line reconciled verdict>", new_questions: [<tagged
        union>], criticism: [<tagged union>], defects: [<tagged union>],
        ledgerRefs: ["goals:<G>"] })` (M = the goal's coordination milestone).
        **Preserve the invariant:** a `revise` must carry non-empty
        `new_questions` and/or `criticism` (those are what `revise` acts on);
        STRICTEST-WINS guarantees this because any reviewer that voted `revise`
        contributed at least one such finding. Stamp `author`/`session`. This is
        the SINGLE `reviews` item for the round.

   2c. **Continue the loop.** Either way — fallback (2a) or reconciled (2b) —
      EXACTLY ONE `reviews` item now exists for this round (no double-write).
      **Continue the loop**: the next `plan-advance` call reads that latest
      review and acts on it (revise the plan, ask new questions, or lock the
      decision and reach `planned`).

3. If the planner returned anything other than `review-requested`, **break**.

The loop terminates on the planner's terminal token; there is no numeric cap to
hit. If you observe the planner↔reviewer pair making no progress toward a
terminal phase (identical plan re-emitted and re-revised with no new criticism
resolved across consecutive iterations — a non-converging single-goal loop),
STOP and report it so the user can inspect the goal manually.

## Auto-investigate filed defects (after the per-goal round)

After the planner↔reviewer round for goal **G** completes, auto-investigate the
defects that round filed — this is **Change A** per decision **K12** (supersedes
K8 pt3's handoff direction only; K8 pts 1/2/4/5 stay in force). Per **Q42**:
auto-launch **always when possible**.

### Worklist = LEDGER QUERY (authoritative — NOT prose-parse)

Derive the worklist from the **ledger**, not from the plan-advance subagent's
prose summary. The subagent emits a single advisory status token; its prose is
ADVISORY ONLY and MUST NOT be the source of truth. Query the ledger by defect
**STATUS** (T116's queryable lifecycle, not a prose marker):

> every **defect** whose `ledgerRefs` link the just-advanced goal (`goals:<G>`)
> and whose `status` is still **ACTIONABLE** — `open`, `wip`, or `inconclusive`.
> (`root-caused` is READY-TO-SEED, handled by the seed gate below — NOT a fresh
> investigate target; `resolved`/`wontfix` are terminal and EXCLUDED.)

(`fts_search`/`search_items` on the `defects` ledger filtered to
`(status:open OR status:wip OR status:inconclusive)` with a `goals:<G>`
ledgerRef; cross-check `fetch_item` as needed). This set — NOT the subagent's
summary — is the auto-investigate worklist for G.

### For each defect D in the worklist

Run **`/investigate:advance D` INLINE** in this same main session, exactly per
llm/commands/investigate/advance.md — **do NOT duplicate or re-implement that
logic; RUN it** (form/extend the hypothesis tree, dispatch read-only explorers,
validate citations, adjudicate). A *command* running another command's loop is
legal under K12; the subagents-cannot-spawn-subagents rule is preserved because
ONLY this orchestrator (a command) does the chaining — the `plan-advance` /
`plan-reviewer` subagents only FILE defects (T73), they never run
`/investigate:advance`.

**When the defect reaches `status == root-caused`** (the READY-TO-SEED gate —
the inline `/investigate:advance` pass sets that status when it adjudicates the
defect's root cause, superseding the former rootCause-marker prose gate), that
pass performs its own file-and-defer handoff: it writes
`defects.rootCause`/`suggestedFix` and **seeds or extends a defect-seeded goal**
G′ (`ledgerRefs: ["defects:<D>"]`, created `planning`, never `clarifying` — K8
pt4). The orchestrator MAY then
**auto-resume planning on that defect-seeded goal G′ in the same session** — run
the per-goal round on G′ (it skips clarification, K8 pt4 — Q42 "always when
possible"). This is convergence (a confirmed cause flowing into reviewed fix
tasks), not a fresh investigate round (see stop predicate (c)).

### awaiting-answers + defects-filed interaction (explicit)

When the primary round for G ended **`awaiting-answers`** (the reviewer's
`new_questions` sent G back to `clarifying`) **WHILE the same review's
`defects[]` were filed**, the two are **ORTHOGONAL**: the filed defects concern
code correctness, NOT G's clarification. Therefore:

- **STILL auto-investigate** the filed defects — run `/investigate:advance D`
  for each, exactly as above. The pending user questions on G do not block
  investigating D.
- **Do NOT auto-resume PLANNING** on a goal parked in `clarifying`. Whether that
  is G itself or a defect-seeded goal G′ that is sitting in `clarifying` on open
  questions, planning resumes **only after the user answers**. Auto-resume is
  permitted only for a defect-seeded goal that is `planning` (clarify-skipped per
  K8 pt4), never one parked on user questions.

### STOP BOUNDARY — concrete predicates (NO hard cap)

There is **NO fixed numeric cap** on the auto-investigate↔replan chain. K12
**removed** the former 4-iteration cap; the generic single-worktree
"no-progress" signals alone do NOT bound this cross-command axis. Instead, apply
**model-judged ill-loop detection** with the CONCRETE, operationally-pinned stop
predicates below. **When ANY predicate holds, STOP auto-relaunching, file an
`open` `questions` item to the user (ledgerRef the defect, and the goal where
relevant), and report it** — these predicates REPLACE the numeric cap:

(a) **Once per round.** Each filed defect D is auto-investigated **AT MOST ONCE
    per `/plan:advance` round.** Do not re-launch `/investigate:advance D` a
    second time within the same round.

(b) **No new evidence ⇒ no relaunch.** Do NOT re-launch on D if its `hypothesis`
    tree gained **NO new `confirmed` node and NO new `[correct]` evidence** since
    the previous round. (Re-running with nothing new cannot make progress.)

(c) **Seeded/extended ⇒ stop and report.** Once a `confirmed` root cause has
    **seeded or extended its defect-seeded goal**, STOP the investigate axis and
    report. Planning then resumes on that seeded goal — that is **convergence,
    not a new investigate round.** (Auto-resume of the seeded goal's *planning*
    is the per-goal round above, governed by K8 pt4, not another investigate
    pass.)

(d) **Non-converging cycle ⇒ stop and park.** A defect cycling
    `open → investigated → replanned → open` **WITHOUT convergence** — i.e.
    re-confirmed with **no NEW fix tasks**, or an **identical re-planned task
    set** to the prior round — STOP and park it on a user question.

(e) **Two dead rounds ⇒ stop and park.** **Two consecutive
    no-adjudicable-evidence rounds** for the same defect (the investigate pass
    came back unable to confirm/rule out anything from available evidence twice
    in a row) → STOP and park it on a user question.

(f) **Bounded per pass.** The per-pass budget is governed by (a)–(e): there is
    no fixed numeric cap, but each defect is bounded (once-per-round, requires
    new confidence to relaunch, stops on convergence or on a non-converging /
    dead cycle), so the pass provably converges.

## Session logs (after EVERY subagent returns)

Each subagent (planner and reviewer) ends its reply with a `### Session summary`
section. After each `Agent` call returns, persist that summary so the run leaves
a durable trace (the subagents are read-only and write nothing themselves):

1. Take `<agent-id>` from the `Agent` tool result (the returned agent id).
2. Stamp `<timestamp>` yourself: `date -u +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S` via `Bash`.
3. `Bash`: `mkdir -p docs/logs` (the dir is tracked via `.gitkeep`).
4. `Write` `docs/logs/<timestamp>-<agent-id>.md` containing a short header
   (which goal, which subagent/role, the returned status token or verdict) and
   the verbatim `### Session summary` block the subagent emitted.
5. **Populate `sessionLogs` on the outcome items** — the orchestrator owns the
   goal's `sessionLogs` write (the planner subagent updates the goal's phase,
   but after its log is written you, the orchestrator, must attach the path):
   - **After the planner returns** and you have written its log file, call
     `update_item("goals", G, fields: { sessionLogs: ["docs/logs/<ts>-<agent-id>.md"] })`
     to record the log path on the goal item. This keeps the goal's session
     provenance without a separate pass.
   - **After the review step completes** — single-reviewer fallback (2a) or
     multi-reviewer reconciliation (2b) — attach the log path(s) to the ONE
     `reviews` item the round produced:
     `update_item("reviews", <reviewId>, fields: { sessionLogs: [<log path(s)>] })`.
     - In the **fallback (2a)** the native reviewer subagent created the review
       item; use the review id it reported (or look it up via `fts_search` on
       the reviews ledger for the just-created verdict), with the one
       `claude`-subagent log path.
     - In the **configured (2b)** path YOU created the aggregated review item
       (sub-step 2b-iii), so you already have its id; attach the log paths for
       **every** reviewer that ran this round (one `claude`-subagent log file per
       `claude:*` reviewer, plus one `pi`-stdout log file per `pi:*` reviewer).

   For each **`pi:*` reviewer** (no `Agent` result, so no returned agent id),
   write a log file the same way: `<timestamp>-pi-<alias>.md` under `docs/logs/`,
   containing a short header (which goal, the reviewer alias + `pi` provider/model,
   the parsed verdict) and the **verbatim captured stdout** (including the raw,
   pre-fence-strip text). This makes each pi reviewer's reply a durable trace
   exactly like the subagent summaries.

Do this for the planner AND every reviewer on every iteration — one log file per
spawned subagent and per pi shellout. The inline `/investigate:advance` pass logs
its own `investigate-explorer` subagents per llm/commands/investigate/advance.md
(§Session logs) — follow that command's logging rule while running it.

## Report to the user

After running the round on every target goal, read each goal
(`fetch_item("goals", <G>)`) for its current phase and give a **per-goal**
summary line (when run with no argument, one line for each goal advanced):
- the goal's id + current phase (`clarifying` / `planning` / `planned` / …);
- what the user must do next:
  - `awaiting-answers` → "answer the N open questions for goal G in the TUI/web,
    then run `/plan:advance G` again" (list the question ids);
  - `completed` → "plan approved and locked; goal G is now `planned`" (point to
    the milestones/tasks and the locked decision); if the goal was already
    `building` or `done` when the planner ran (no planning step needed), report
    the current phase and note that implementation is in progress or already
    complete — the user closes `building→done` via the TUI/web;
  - `noop` → why there was nothing to do.

Then, for the **auto-investigate phase**, add a line per defect D in the worklist
covering its outcome and the next action:
- **root-caused → seeded goal** — defect reached `status == root-caused`;
  defect-seeded goal G′ created/extended (ledgerRef `defects:<D>`). If G′ was
  auto-resumed and reached `planned`, say so (point to the fix tasks); else:
  "run `/plan:advance G′`".
- **parked on a question** — a stop predicate (d)/(e) or step-6 block fired; an
  `open` question was filed. "Answer question Qn in the TUI/web, then re-run."
- **no-new-evidence-stopped** — predicate (b): the tree gained no new
  `confirmed`/`[correct]` evidence, so D was not relaunched; another
  `/investigate:advance D` round is warranted only if new leads emerge.
- **ill-loop-stopped** — predicate (a)/(c)/(d)/(e)/(f) bounded the pass; state
  which predicate held and the filed question.

When no argument was given, finish with a one-line roll-up covering BOTH axes
(e.g. "3 goals advanced: 1 planned, 2 awaiting answers; 2 defects
auto-investigated: 1 confirmed→seeded goal, 1 parked on a question").

---

## Handoff record (STANDALONE only — suppressed when chained)

> **Your stop is PROGRESS-bounded, never EFFORT-bounded.** Stop ONLY when this
> flow's own stop predicate fires — a terminal planner token (`awaiting-answers`
> / `completed` / `noop`), the auto-investigate stop predicates (a)–(f), or
> everything parked on an `open` user question — NEVER because the run is long,
> costly, used many subagents, reached "a natural milestone", or the remaining
> work feels disproportionate. The handoff status you write is the gate: one of
> `drained` / `answers-required` / `mixed` / `illness-detected`, each requiring a
> real predicate condition — there is no status for an effort-based stop. If
> tempted to stop while progress is still possible, CONTINUE. (See
> llm/commands/advance.md §Stop condition.)

Whether you write a `handoffs` record at your stop depends ENTIRELY on your
invocation context — there is **no env var or process signal** to read. You,
the executing agent, run both this command and (when chained) the wrapping
`/advance` command in the SAME inline session, so you already KNOW which
context you are in.

- **Run STANDALONE** (the user invoked `/plan:advance` directly, with no
  wrapping flow command): after the §Report, write ONE `handoffs` record for
  this stop — `create_item("handoffs", <milestone>, <status>, <fields>)` —
  mapping your end-of-round classification (across BOTH axes) to the handoff
  `status`:

  | This round's stop                                                          | handoff `status`   |
  | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
  | every target goal reached `planned`/terminal, nothing left to advance      | `drained`          |
  | one or more goals/defects `awaiting-answers` / parked on an `open` question | `answers-required` |
  | both at once — some goals planned/drained, others awaiting answers          | `mixed`            |
  | a stop predicate (a)/(c)–(f) bounded the pass / an invariant violation      | `illness-detected` |

  Field set (per `HANDOFFS_SCHEMA`; consistent with advance.md §Provenance):
  `summary` (**required** — the why-it-stopped prose, mirror the §Report);
  `flow` = `plan`; `ledgerRefs` = the stop-causing items (`goals:<G>`,
  `defects:<D>`); `blockingQuestions` = the `open` question ids for an
  `answers-required`/`mixed` stop; `handoffReasons` = the component reasons for
  a `mixed` stop (e.g. `[drained, answers-required]`); `sessionLogs` = the
  `docs/logs/<ts>-<agent-id>.md` path(s) written this round — populate them in
  the SAME `create_item` call. Stamp `author`/`session`. Append-only: written
  once at the stop, never updated. (The auto-investigate sub-rounds this command
  chains do NOT each write a handoff — investigate/advance.md suppresses its own
  handoff whenever chained, so this one record covers the whole pass.)

- **Run CHAINED INLINE by any wrapping flow command** (`/advance`, or a
  `/<flow>:start` / `/<flow>:follow-up` that runs this pass inline):
  **SUPPRESS this handoff write.** The outermost wrapper owns the single
  authoritative run-level handoff and writes it once at its stop — `/advance`
  per its §Provenance (it is the sole `handoffs` writer for the whole run);
  a `/<flow>:start` or `/<flow>:follow-up` writes it directly in its own
  §Handoff record step. You can tell you are in this context because the
  wrapping command explicitly chains you and its prompt instructs this
  suppression; a standalone invocation has no such wrapper. Suppressing here is
  what guarantees exactly ONE handoff per run — never a duplicate.
