- headline: Add explicit per-task worktree teardown to implement/advance.md §7.3 (Claude path)
- description: "In nix/pkg/cq-assets/commands/cq/implement/advance.md §7 merge-back step 3 (verified text at L310-311: 'Then remove the worktree (Claude: auto; Codex: `git worktree remove` + delete the branch).'), REPLACE the Claude-side 'auto' with an EXPLICIT teardown the orchestrator runs immediately after the per-task `done` ledger write, symmetric with the Codex path: `git worktree remove --force <wt> && git branch -D implement/<taskId> && git worktree prune`. Document WHY (Q167/grounding): native Agent isolation:worktree only auto-removes UNCHANGED worktrees, but a worker that committed its task IS changed, so it is never auto-removed — the source of the ~140 stale locked worktrees under .claude/worktrees/. Embed a verbatim grep-able marker on the new instruction: `G38-1a-post-done-cleanup`. Do NOT touch §5 (blocked-task worktrees stay intact). NOTE (R372/opus, VERIFIED): commands/cq/implement/advance.md IS catalogued by gen-agents-catalogue.ts (ROLES id 'implement/advance', body captured as promptTemplate), so editing its body changes agentsCatalogue.gen.ts — the regen is handled by the dedicated task T322 (do not regen here)."
- acceptance: grep -F 'G38-1a-post-done-cleanup' nix/pkg/cq-assets/commands/cq/implement/advance.md returns exactly one line; the Claude-side per-merge removal is now an EXPLICIT command (the literal sequence 'git worktree remove --force' ... 'git branch -D implement/' ... 'git worktree prune' present in the §7 merge-back region) rather than the prior native-'auto'; §5's 'worktree INTACT' sentence (L281) is unchanged. bun run check (from nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/) green.

- description: "In nix/pkg/cq-assets/commands/cq/implement/advance.md §1 (Derive the READY-SET), alongside the resume-bookkeeping paragraph, ADD a start-of-pass sweep step: before deriving the ready-set, the orchestrator prunes orphaned/locked worktrees left by prior interrupted runs — `git worktree prune` plus, for each worktree under the implement worktree root whose `implement/<taskId>` task is already terminal (`done`/`abandoned`) in the ledger, `git worktree remove --force` + `git branch -D implement/<taskId>`. Explicitly EXCLUDE worktrees for tasks still `blocked`/`wip` (the §5 blocked worktrees MUST survive until resumed/abandoned). Embed a verbatim grep-able marker `G38-1a-start-sweep`. Addresses the ~140 stale locked worktrees observed. dependsOn T308 is a SAME-FILE SERIALIZATION edge (per R372/codex+grok): §1 and §7.3 are logically independent edits, but both mutate implement/advance.md — serializing them avoids a concurrent-worktree merge conflict on the same file; it is NOT a logical data prerequisite."

- description: "Update nix/pkg/cq-assets/agents/implement-worker.md so the worker prompt states that the orchestrator removes the worker's worktree (`git worktree remove --force` + `git worktree prune`) AFTER the per-task done write / merge-back, so the worker need not preserve it and must not improvise its own cross-checkout cleanup (consistent with the D43 worktree-confinement Boundary). This is item-1a prompt-only scope (worker.md is a cq-assets prompt; aligning it keeps the cleanup coherent across orchestrator + worker). Embed a verbatim grep-able marker `G38-1a-worker-ephemeral`. Do NOT run gen-agents here — the agentsCatalogue.gen.ts regen for ALL three 1a asset edits (this + the two advance.md edits) is the dedicated task T322.

- acceptance: bun test (from nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/) runs the new describe block; all source + gen.ts marker cells pass; deliberately breaking one marker in its source .md makes exactly that cell fail (teeth verified), restoring it returns to 0 fail; a stale (un-regenerated) agentsCatalogue.gen.ts fails the gen.ts cells. bun run check green.

On each mutation, mirror ONLY the file(s) the op touched (per Q168): the changed docs/<ledgerId>.md, plus on an `archive` op the new archive file + docs/ledgers.yaml. Overwrite-in-place single latest mirror (no journal, no rotation). Reuse the store's existing atomic-write primitive (tmp + rename). Wire it into FsLedgerStore.fireMutation() AFTER the existing onMutation hook, guarded so a mirror failure is swallowed (logged to stderr) exactly like onMutation — it MUST NOT block or unwind the write path. onMutation(ledgerId, op) carries the ledgerId not a file path, so map ledgerId→ledgerPath internally (the store owns docsDir/archiveDir/registryPath/rootDir).

The restore handler resolves the root (--cwd > $LEDGER_ROOT > CWD; absolute or resolved vs CWD per repo convention), recomputes the cache dir via the SHARED cacheMirrorDir() function from T312 (single import, no divergent copy), and atomically copies the mirror back into <root>/docs/ (symmetric with FsLedgerStore.reset(): read mirror, atomic tmp+rename onto each in-repo path). Refuse with a clear non-zero error if the cache dir is absent/empty. Print a per-ledger restored-file-count summary (ResetSummary style). Update --help/usage. IMPORTANT (R372/opus+codex+minimax): the main.ts header comment (L23-24) currently states lifecycle ops (backup+reinit, erase) live in the `cq` CLI and 'this server only serves the tool surface' — adding `restore` here CONTRADICTS that boundary, so UPDATE that header comment to record that `restore --from-cache` is now hosted by ledger-mcp (per the Q169 decision) while the other lifecycle ops remain in `cq`.

- description: "Fixes D44 (part 2). In ledger-tui/src/app.tsx useInput CONTENT-focus branch (~L802-834), ADD Home/End: Home → scroll 0, End → scroll contentMaxScroll; PgUp/PgDn continue to page content by CONTENT_PAGE (unchanged). Detect Home/End via the SHARED module-level `matchHomeEnd(input)` helper introduced in T318 (do NOT duplicate the sequence-matching). This task OWNS its CONTENT-focus tests."
- acceptance: "ink-testing-library test cells (authored here): enter an item (Enter → content focus) with content taller than the pane; End jumps scroll to the bottom (clamped to contentMaxScroll), Home returns to 0; PgUp/PgDn still move by CONTENT_PAGE. Home/End fed as raw ESC sequences via the shared matchHomeEnd helper. bun run check green."

- acceptance: bun test (from nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/) passes the new ledger-tui cells; nix build .#ledger-tui succeeds; bun run check green.
