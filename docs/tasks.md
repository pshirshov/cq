- headline: Pretty-print + colorize JSON code fences + wrap long lines in the ledger-web Markdown renderer (fix D57)
- description: |
    Fix D57 (confirmed root cause H36). SCOPE DECISION (orchestrator, per the goal's open scope question): apply GLOBALLY in the shared Markdown component — pretty-printing + wrapping a json code fence is universally desirable for any markdown field in ledger-web (json fences appear chiefly in the session-log popup but pretty-print helps anywhere), and a global components.code renderer is simpler + lower-risk than a popup-scoped variant/prop. Implement in packages/ledger-web/src/:
    (1) Markdown.tsx — pass a `components` map to <ReactMarkdown> with a `code` renderer. For a fenced block whose language is `json` (className `language-json`) OR whose raw text JSON.parse-es successfully: re-serialize via JSON.stringify(parsed, null, 2) and render a colorized <pre><code> — a SMALL hand-rolled, theme-var-keyed JSON tokenizer emitting <span> classes (e.g. lw-json-key / lw-json-string / lw-json-number / lw-json-bool / lw-json-null / lw-json-punct) is preferred over adding a heavy highlighter dependency. CRITICAL: the pretty-print MUST be SAFE — wrap JSON.parse in try/catch and on ANY failure (or non-json fence) fall back to rendering the raw code UNCHANGED (never throw, never lose content). Inline code (no language / not a fenced block) renders as today. Preserve rehype-sanitize (the colorizer spans are produced by the React `code` component AFTER sanitize, so they are safe — confirm sanitize doesn't strip them; if it does, scope the span classNames via the allowed attributes or render via the component, not raw HTML).
    (2) styles.css — add `white-space: pre-wrap; overflow-wrap: anywhere;` to `.lw-md pre` (and confirm `.lw-md pre code`) so any long line wraps instead of horizontally overflowing; add the `.lw-json-*` token colors keyed to the existing theme CSS vars (e.g. --fg, accent vars used elsewhere), readable on the dark `#0c0e12` code background.
    Keep it surgical — do not change other markdown rendering behavior. Linked defect: D57.
- acceptance: "happy-dom test (packages/ledger-web/test/, e.g. Markdown.test.tsx or extend an existing one): (a) a single-line ```json fence (e.g. {\"a\":1,\"b\":[2,3]}) renders MULTI-LINE pretty-printed output (the rendered text contains newlines / the 2-space-indented form) AND carries the colorizer token spans (e.g. a .lw-json-key element); (b) an INVALID-json ```json fence (e.g. `not json`) falls back to the raw text UNCHANGED (no throw, content preserved); (c) a non-json fenced block (e.g. ```sh) is unaffected; (d) the `.lw-md pre` rule includes white-space:pre-wrap (assert via the stylesheet or a computed check if feasible, else assert the CSS source contains it). Existing ledger-web Markdown/LogModal tests pass unchanged. `bun run check` (from nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/) green; `nix build .#ledger-web` green."

- headline: Add mcp|tui|web mode routing to the cq dispatcher with verbatim argv pass-through
- description: |
    In packages/cq-cli/src/main.ts add a MODES routing layer in `dispatch()` that runs BEFORE the native subcommand parsing (`isSubcommand`/`parseSubcommandArgs`). Define MODES = {mcp, tui, web}. When argv[0] is a mode, dynamically `import` the matching package and call its EXPORTED `main(argv.slice(1))` VERBATIM. ARGV CONVENTION (R466 clarification): cq-cli's own `main(argv)` already receives `process.argv.slice(2)` (no binary name), so for `cq mcp --cwd X` cq's argv is `['mcp','--cwd','X']`; dropping the mode token with `argv.slice(1)` yields `['--cwd','X']` — EXACTLY what each product's `main(argv)` expects (the equivalent of its own `process.argv.slice(2)`). This also makes `cq mcp restore --from-cache` deliver `['restore','--from-cache']` to ledger-mcp's main (its nested restore dispatch). The post-mode argv must NOT pass through parseSubcommandArgs (native-flag-specific: --cwd/--yes/--force/--to/--session). cq mcp's stdout must stay protocol-only — print nothing on the mcp path. Keep the existing native subcommands (init/reset/erase/move-ledger/advance-gate) on their current path.
    
    ENTRY WIRING (R466, opus-grounded — the load-bearing fix):
    - @cq/ledger-mcp exports `main(argv)` and @cq/ledger-web exports `main(argv)`/`serve` that take argv directly → call `(await import('@cq/ledger-mcp')).main(argv.slice(1))` etc.
    - @cq/ledger-tui exports NO argv-taking entry: its `run()` is module-private and reads `process.argv.slice(2)`; only parseArgs/normalizeUrl/liveUrlFor/TUI_RENDER_OPTIONS are exported. So THIS TASK MUST ADD a thin `export async function main(argv: readonly string[])` to packages/ledger-tui/src/main.tsx by refactoring `run()` to take an explicit `argv` param (and update the `import.meta.main` self-run to call `main(process.argv.slice(2))`). Then cq's tui path calls that new exported main with the post-mode argv. Do NOT mutate process.argv as a workaround — add the export.
    
    EMBEDDED-MODE INVARIANCE (R466 — corrected rationale): embedded-vs-remote is selected by the ABSENCE of `--mcp-url` (ledger-web serve.ts:201 `opts.mcpUrl !== null`; ledger-tui main.tsx:102 `mcpUrl !== null`), NOT by import.meta.main. In-process delegation preserves embedded mode simply because the delegated argv omits --mcp-url (TUI in-memory transport + web /mcp+/ws co-hosting stay active). The exported main(argv) functions are pure of any import.meta.main dependence at call time.
- acceptance: "`bun packages/cq-cli/src/main.ts mcp --help` prints ledger-mcp's TOP_LEVEL_USAGE; `bun packages/cq-cli/src/main.ts web --port 5199` starts the embedded web server + prints an http URL; `bun packages/cq-cli/src/main.ts tui` launches the Ink app against the cwd ledger via the NEW ledger-tui `main(argv)` export; `cq mcp --cwd X` delivers `['--cwd','X']` to ledger-mcp's main (verbatim, no native re-parse); ledger-tui's own bin/self-run still works via main(process.argv.slice(2)). bun run typecheck + lint green."

- description: Extend the USAGE constant in packages/cq-cli/src/main.ts so `cq --help` and any unknown/absent subcommand list the three new modes (mcp/tui/web, each noting verbatim flag pass-through + `cq mcp restore --from-cache`) alongside the existing init/reset/erase/move-ledger/advance-gate entries. Match the existing USAGE table formatting. Ensure `cq` with no args and `cq <garbage>` still exit the usage code with this combined usage to stderr; and that `cq mcp` with no further args is treated as a valid mode invocation (not unknown-command).
- acceptance: USAGE contains 'mcp', 'tui', 'web' + the five native subcommands; `bun packages/cq-cli/src/main.ts` (no args) prints all modes+commands and exits the usage code. bun run check green.

Do NOT delete the source files or the exported main()/serve()/attachMcpHttp/createLedgerMcpServer — only the `bin` registration. Keep the `import.meta.main` guards (harmless; the bins no longer point at them, and in-process delegation runs with import.meta.main false). Verify nothing else in the workspace references those three bin names."
- acceptance: The three package.json files have no `bin` key; bun run typecheck green; importing each package still yields its exported main/serve; no remaining workspace reference to the three bin names. (cq mcp/tui/web still work via the T387 dispatch.)

Therefore: FIRST EXTRACT the inline tui staging (ink/react links + ledger-tui source) and the inline web staging (ledger-web source + react/react-dom/react-markdown/remark-gfm/rehype-sanitize/elkjs links + index.html + the LEDGER_WEB_OUTDIR writable-bundle wrapper env) into NEW named `let` fragments (e.g. `tuiClosure`, `webClosure`) alongside embedServerClosure — BEFORE/within this task, so T392's deletion of ledgerTui/ledgerWeb does not remove staging logic cqCli now needs. THEN have cqCli reuse `embedServerClosure` + `tuiClosure` + `webClosure` + the existing cq-cli/@cq/ledger/@cq/config staging, and wire the @cq/ledger-{mcp,tui,web,live} workspace symlinks into packages/cq-cli/node_modules/@cq/ so the dispatcher's dynamic imports resolve. The wrapper still targets cq-cli/src/main.ts and carries the LEDGER_WEB_OUTDIR env. RISK: a missing SPA-build symlink → `cq web` fails at Bun.build startup; a missing embed link → embedded /mcp breaks — caught by the T397 launches."

(The green `nix build .#cq` is gated after T396 FOD-refresh in T397; this task's acceptance is the closure-input checklist + extraction being complete + reviewable.)"
