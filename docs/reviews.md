### R265 — revise

- createdAt: 2026-06-07T19:53:17.679Z
- updatedAt: 2026-06-07T19:54:02.700Z
- author: "opus-4.8[1m]"
- session: 994b02a0-7e3f-40df-81ed-b12b9ce6b13e
- summary: REVISE (3/4 reviewers usable; minimax abstained — no API key). opus + grok + codex all voted revise. Plan is well-grounded and largely fine-grained/testable, but has a critical feasibility hole (no per-agent tier SOURCE), a false dependency edge, a runtime-config-access gap, T222 mis-grounding, a Q126 end-to-end-verification gap, and acceptance imprecision. One user-only new_question on the Q126 dispatch-trigger mechanism.
- new_questions: ["[opus] Q126/Q130 require the shared cq command prompts to work byte-for-byte UNCHANGED under Pi, yet those prompts currently encode only a Claude ('Agent tool + subagent_type') and Codex ('native multi_agent') dispatch branch with NO Pi branch. How is the new Pi dispatch tool expected to be invoked from the unchanged prompt text — must it be named/shaped so the existing 'Agent'/'subagent_type' wording already triggers it, or is a harness-agnostic dispatch instruction to be added to a Pi-side asset (e.g. pi-context.md / APPEND_SYSTEM.md — itself an asset addition, though NOT a cq command-prompt edit)? This determines whether 'prompts unchanged' is achievable Pi-side at all, and whether a (permitted) Pi-side context addition is in scope."]
- criticism: ["[opus+grok+codex] CRITICAL feasibility hole: the plan assumes each agent carries a tier so T225 can 'resolve child model from the agent tier via [tiers]', but the cq agent markdown frontmatter is name/description/disallowedTools ONLY (no suggestedModel/tier field), and cq-assets must stay byte-identical (Q126). As written T225 is unimplementable. The revised plan MUST define the per-agent tier SOURCE — e.g. (a) an additive agent-name->tier map alongside [tiers] in cq.toml, (b) the orchestrator passes the tier explicitly at dispatch (Q127: 'orchestrator names which agent to run'), or (c) add a tier field to agent frontmatter (assess Q126 impact + whether Claude tolerates it) — then thread it through T222/T224/T225.","[opus+grok] T223 (add [tiers] + parse in @cq/ledger config layer) declares dependsOn T221 but is pure TypeScript/TOML config work independent of the child-session-spawn spike (its own description says 'independent of the extension implementation'). Remove the false T221 edge so M89/T223 runs concurrently with the spike.","[grok+codex] No task addresses how the standalone store-path .ts extension (loaded by the vendored pi-coding-agent runtime via settings.extensions) obtains the [tiers]/agent-tier config AT RUNTIME — cross-workspace import from @cq/ledger vs locating+parsing cq.toml directly vs inlining. T225 requires this resolution INSIDE the extension; add a task/step pinning the runtime config-access strategy.","[grok+codex] T222 mis-grounds + mis-scopes: it says 'materialize mergedAgents' but the extension (T224) reads individual nix/pkg/cq-assets/agents/<name>.md files — name the exact discoverable dir/files; and its git-diff acceptance wrongly includes '+ new pi-extensions files' (extension authoring/registration happen in T224/T225, not T222).","[opus] No task verifies the central Q126 constraint END-TO-END: T226/T227 invoke the tool DIRECTLY (dispatch_agent({agent,task})) rather than driving the actual unchanged cq command prompt under the wrapped Pi harness and observing it fire the dispatch. Add an acceptance step that runs an unchanged cq prompt under Pi AND a `git diff` assertion that nix/pkg/cq-assets is untouched.","[opus] T221 acceptance is internally inconsistent: it enumerates FIVE primitives {registerTool, child-session spawn, tool-filtering, model/provider pin, output capture} but states 'GO = all four primitives'. Fix the count (the two existing extensions prove registerProvider/on but NOT registerTool, so registerTool genuinely needs confirming).","[opus+codex] T222 acceptance only asserts the agent files EXIST on disk and leaves the exposure mechanism undecided (env var vs pi settings field); it does not assert the path is reachable/readable by the extension at runtime. Pin the exposure mechanism and add a runtime-resolve check to the T222->T224 hand-off.","[grok+codex] Acceptance for T224/T225/T226/T227 lacks an exact command/invocation/capture mechanism (pi flags, cwd, transcript capture) unlike the concrete 'bun test' / 'nix build' criteria — tighten each to a verifiable command + observable.","[codex] No task isolates/sequences the dev-llm.nix settings.extensions REGISTRATION of the new extension separately from its authoring; T224 acceptance leans on `nix build` succeeding (implying the wiring) but the registration step is not called out.","[codex contingency] Make T221's NO-GO branch a first-class contingency in the plan: if Pi 0.78.0's ExtensionAPI lacks the child-session-spawn / tool-filtering / per-child model-pin primitives, the locked mechanism (Q125/Q130) and possibly G28 scope must be revisited rather than every later milestone proceeding on an assumed GO. (Largely subsumed by T221 — add it as an explicit contingency note, not a separately-filed defect.)"]

### R266 — revise

- summary: "ROUND 2 REVISE (opus go-ahead; grok + codex revise; minimax abstained — no API key). All ten R265 findings confirmed resolved and K44's Q126 reasoning judged sound. Remaining: planner-fixable sequencing/milestone-placement violation + a real completeness gap (no task authors/verifies the Pi-side dispatch-trigger instruction K44 relies on) + two minor labeling/acceptance tightenings. No new_questions, no out-of-scope defects — converging."
- new_questions: []
- criticism: ["[grok+codex] SEQUENCING/MILESTONE violation: T224 is in M88 (whose only milestone dep is M87) but dependsOn T228, which is in M89 (deps T223). So a task in M88 depends on a task in a LATER milestone (M89), and M88's milestone-level deps don't reflect it. Restructure so the real order T223->T228->T224 is consistent: e.g. move T228 (and/or T224) so no task depends on a later-milestone task, OR add the M88<-M89 milestone edge, OR fold the tier-routing prerequisites (T223/T228) into a milestone that precedes the extension. Fix the milestone graph + task placement to match the dependsOn edges.","[codex] COMPLETENESS gap (the dispatch trigger K44 relies on is never authored): per K44 the unchanged cq command prompt fires the Pi dispatch tool either because the tool's shape matches the existing named-agent+task wording AND/OR because a harness-agnostic dispatch instruction lives in a Pi-side asset (pi-context.md / APPEND_SYSTEM / programs.pi wiring). But NO task authors or verifies that Pi-side dispatch instruction — T224 only registers the tool + dispatch shape + settings.extensions entry, and T226/T227 ASSUME the unchanged promptTemplate (run under piWrapped) makes the model EMIT the dispatch call rather than prose. Add an explicit task (prerequisite of the T226/T227 end-to-end demos) that authors the Pi-side dispatch-trigger instruction (pi-context.md/APPEND_SYSTEM addition + any programs.pi wiring) and whose acceptance confirms an unchanged prompt actually fires the tool — without it the acceptance demos cannot pass.","[codex] T228 acceptance is underspecified: it requires only 'a written decision concrete enough for T224' but does not name the ARTIFACT location (a decisions ledger item / docs/drafts/*.md / a pinned source comment) nor how T224/T225 reference+consume it without re-deciding. Pin the artifact location and the consumption contract.","[codex] Labeling/ordering artifacts reduce sequenced-flow clarity: non-sequential task IDs (T223, T228, then T224-T227), T228 under M89 directly feeding T224 under M88, and T223 labeled 'deps NONE, runs concurrently' while its outputs are strict prereqs of T228/T224/T225. Clean up the milestone/label structure so the sequenced flow is unambiguous (consequence of the sequencing fix above)."]

- summary: "ROUND 3 REVISE (opus go-ahead + grok go-ahead; codex revise; minimax abstained). All R266 findings confirmed resolved. Only codex's 3 MINOR planner-fixable nitpicks remain: a spurious M89->M87 milestone edge, and T224 acceptance not stating explicitly that the child uses the parent-model DEFAULT there (tier resolution is deliberately T225). Converging — no new_questions, no out-of-scope defects."
- new_questions: []
- criticism: ["[codex] Spurious milestone edge: M89.dependsOn=[M87] is not backed by any task dependency — T223 has no deps and T228 depends only on T223; neither depends on T221 (the M87 spike). Remove M87 from M89.dependsOn (M89 config/tier work is independent of the child-session spike), so milestone deps reflect real task deps. (Minor/advisory — the prior round added the M88<-M89 edge correctly; this is the symmetric cleanup on M89 itself.)","[codex] T224 acceptance clarity: T224 deliberately defaults the child model to the PARENT's active model (full tier resolution is T225's job), but neither the acceptance nor codex's reading makes that explicit — codex misread it as an inverted prerequisite (T224 'requiring' tier resolution). Reword T224's description/acceptance to state plainly that tiered/per-agent model selection is NOT exercised in T224 (child uses parent-model default) and is added+verified in T225, so the T224->T225 split is unambiguous.","[codex] T224 acceptance is less concrete than T229/T226/T227 on what the 'dispatch' step exercises: state that the manual dispatch_agent probe in T224 verifies tool registration + filtered-child-spawn + result capture ONLY (NOT tier selection), with the concrete observable (non-empty result + child lacks the dispatch tool) — tighten to match the precision of the other tasks' acceptance."]

Milestone DAG (M87(—), M89(—), M88[M87,M89], M90[M88,M89], M91[M90]) is acyclic and consistent with every task's dependsOn; no task depends on a later-milestone task.

Plan is well-structured + correctly grounded in the 3-layer architecture, DAG acyclic; but carries a wrong cq.toml.example path, a missing T234→T232 edge + an activation-ordering hazard that can break the running MCP, T233 wording contradicting the bare-reject, incomplete test-migration scope, and underspecified cross-layer-test/acceptance precision. All planner-fixable; no new_questions; no out-of-scope defects."
- new_questions: []
- criticism: ["[opus] WRONG PATH: cq.toml.example is at the REPO ROOT (`cq.toml.example`), NOT `nix/pkg/cq-ledgers/cq.toml.example` — it holds the [tiers] block T234 must qualify. Fix the path in T234 (migrate), T237 (docs header), and T239 (the `rg` bare-pi audit path).","[opus+codex+grok] T234 is missing `dependsOn: T232`: its acceptance uses `get_config`/computeReviewers to show provider-qualified tokens, which REQUIRES T232's provider-surfacing through @cq/ledger + @cq/ledger-mcp. Add T232 to T234's dependsOn.","[opus] ACTIVATION-ORDERING HAZARD (T231→T234): T231 makes @cq/config loadConfig THROW on any bare `pi:<model>`, and the live (gitignored) repo-root cq.toml — codex/grok=`pi:grok-build`, minimax=`pi:minimax-m3` — is the exact config the RUNNING ledger MCP re-reads on every get_config/get_reviewers/get_planners call. A build+MCP-restart in the T231→T234 window throws on every read and breaks the orchestrator mid-flow. Constrain the live-cq.toml migration (T234) to co-merge with / precede T231's activation, and have the T239 gate assert the live config loads.","[codex+grok+minimax] T233 wording is contradictory: 'no `/` → null → parent fallback' reads like the PRE-D36 behavior. Reword to the post-fix observable: the extension mirror REFUSES a bare `pi:<model>` (tokenToChildModel returns null so it never dispatches provider-less), consistent with @cq/config THROWING on bare; T238 asserts BOTH layers refuse bare. State precisely what is returned/thrown for bare vs qualified, pi vs claude.","[opus+codex+grok] T235 test-migration scope may be incomplete: it adapts ONLY `packages/cq-config/test/config.test.ts`. Adding `provider` to the structural ResolvedReviewer/GetConfigResult + ledger-mcp projection (T232) can break any @cq/ledger-mcp config-capability test that deep-asserts the old `{harness,model}` shape. Verify and FOLD any such ledger-mcp test (and any other bare-pi fixture anywhere) into T235, so the T239 repo-wide `rg` audit has no unplanned survivor (and a remediation path if it finds one).","[codex+grok] T238 (end-to-end + cross-layer tests) `dependsOn` omits T235 — it shares config.test.ts and needs the pre-existing suite stable. Add T235. Also SPECIFY the cross-layer invariant concretely: for a shared token-fixture table, parseReviewerToken(s) accepts iff the extension's tokenToChildModel(s) accepts, and both agree on (harness, model, provider) — implemented by copying the extension's parse into the test (it cannot be imported). Make T238's acceptance 'bun test PASSES verifying X' (run+observe), not merely 'add test'.","[grok] T234 acceptance is not reproducible in a clean checkout/CI because the live cq.toml is gitignored: scope the REPRODUCIBLE acceptance assertion to `cq.toml.example` (a test loads it and resolves minimax→ollama-cloud), and treat the live-cq.toml edit as a documented local step that the T239 gate spot-checks via get_config in this session.","[grok] T239 `dependsOn` omits T231 explicitly (it is transitively covered via T232 etc.) — add T231 for an unambiguous gate; and the verification gate should fail loudly with a remediation pointer if the `rg` audit finds any un-migrated bare-pi token.","[grok+codex] Acceptance-precision + minor redundancy: make T236 (decisions item) cite T225's recorded live `--provider ollama-cloud` evidence as the empirical anchor (Q136), and tighten T237 doc acceptance to a concrete observable; T231's gate should be scoped to the NEW parse-case tests + typecheck (full pre-existing suite pass is deferred to T235/T238/T239 since the breaking grammar breaks old fixtures until T235). [minimax] add a sanity check in T234 that each migrated `<model>` exists under its target provider (guard against a typo like 'minmax')."]

Reconciled APPROVE (opus authoritative; minimax findings non-blocking by rubric). minimax's genuine concern (silent first-match on a token classified under two [tiers] entries vs fail-loud) filed as defect D42 (file-and-defer, FIX). resolveTierToken removed; classifyToken/selectTokensForTier added; resolveAgentModel re-pointed (now requires a candidates arg); no external consumers."
