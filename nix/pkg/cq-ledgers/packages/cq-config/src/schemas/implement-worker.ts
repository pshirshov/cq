/**
 * implement-worker role schema sidecar (T341, goal G41) — generalising the T336
 * one-role proof across the dispatched-subagent roster (storage-format decision
 * 3: per-role typed sidecar co-located under `./schemas/`).
 *
 * Authored DIRECTLY from `cq-assets/agents/implement-worker.md` — its
 * `## Catalogue` block:
 *
 * - **Input** — the task spec the orchestrator passes verbatim (task id +
 *   headline + description + acceptance), the worktree path + branch
 *   (`implement/<taskId>`), the base commit, and an optional prior-round
 *   `criticism[]` on a re-dispatch after review. The resolved model class is
 *   informational; it is not load-bearing for the dispatch contract.
 *
 * - **Output** — the worker result block
 *   `{ taskId, status, resultCommit, branch, filesTouched, checkSummary,
 *   summary, blockedReason? }`. `status` is `pass | fail`; `resultCommit` is the
 *   commit sha on pass and `null` on fail.
