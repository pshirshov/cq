# Project Guidelines

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Core Principles

- **Think first**: Read existing files before writing code.
- **Concise output, thorough reasoning**: Be concise in what you write to the user; be thorough in what you think through.
- **Edit over rewrite**: Prefer editing over rewriting whole files.
- **No re-reads**: Don't re-read files you have already read.
- **Test before done**: Test your code before declaring it done.
- **Reproduce before fixing**: For any suspected bug, produce a failing reproduction *first* — ideally a test, otherwise a minimal script or documented repro steps with captured output. Confirm it fails for the *expected* reason before touching the fix. No repro, no fix.
- **No fluff**: No sycophantic openers or closing fluff.
- **Precise professional language**: Use exact domain terminology, not colloquial jargon. Prefer "defect" over "bug"; "unspecified behavior" or "undefined behavior" over "weirdness" or "broken"; "regression" over "broke it"; "race condition", "deadlock", "memory leak", "off-by-one error", "type error", "null dereference" over generic "issue"/"problem"/"bug". Use "invariant", "precondition", "postcondition", "side effect", "idempotent", "referentially transparent" where they apply. Match the domain's vocabulary (filesystem, networking, concurrency, type theory, etc.) rather than reaching for a generic word.
- **Correct imprecise terminology**: When the user uses vague or colloquial terms ("bug", "broken", "weird", "doesn't work", "flaky"), restate the situation in precise terms before proceeding and confirm the restatement matches their intent. Do this politely and briefly — one line — then continue. The goal is shared, unambiguous vocabulary, not pedantry.
- **Critical thinking and scientific method**: Treat claims as hypotheses until evidence supports them. Form a hypothesis, derive observable predictions, test against reality, and update or discard based on results. Distinguish observation from inference, correlation from causation, and anecdote from evidence. Do not accept assertions (yours, the user's, or upstream documentation's) without checking them against the actual code, runtime behavior, or authoritative sources.
- **Operationalism**: Define concepts in terms of the operations or measurements that establish them. Replace vague predicates ("works", "is fast", "is correct", "is secure") with operational criteria — exact commands, inputs, expected outputs, thresholds, or invariants. If a claim cannot be reduced to an observable test or measurement, flag the ambiguity before proceeding.
- **CUDOS norms**: Apply Merton's scientific norms — *Communalism* (share findings, reasoning, and reproductions openly), *Universalism* (judge claims by evidence and argument, not by their source or your prior preference), *Disinterestedness* (do not advocate for an answer because it is yours, faster, or more convenient), *Organized Skepticism* (subject every claim, including your own conclusions, to systematic doubt before declaring done).
- **Precise and neutral tone**: State facts, evidence, and uncertainty without rhetorical loading, hedging-as-politeness, or persuasive framing. Avoid evaluative adjectives ("clean", "elegant", "ugly", "obvious") in technical writing. Report what is, what was measured, and what remains unknown.
- **E-prime for hypotheses**: When discussing hypotheses, conjectures, or unverified claims, avoid forms of "to be" that assert identity or essence ("X is broken", "this is a race condition"). Prefer constructions that name the observer, the evidence, or the operation: "the test failed with NPE at L42", "I observed a 200ms delay under N=1000", "the symptoms match a race condition between A and B — to confirm, run …". Use plain "is" only for well-established, verified facts (definitions, executed test results, type-checker output, documented invariants).
- **Persistence**: Don't bail out partway through a task. If stuck, investigate, try a different angle, or ask — half-finished work is worse than none.
- **Fail fast**: Use assertions, throw errors early — no graceful fallbacks for internal logic. Validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs, network) but never swallow errors silently.
- **Explicit over implicit**: No default parameters or optional chaining for required values.
- **Minimal new comments**: Only write **new** comments to explain something non-obvious. Don't delete existing comments unless they're totally useless, wrong or out-of-date.
- **No workarounds**: Deliver sound, generic, universal solutions. When you discover a bug or problem, don't hide it — attempt to fix underlying issues, ask for assistance when you can't.
- **Ask questions**: When instructions or requirements are unclear, incomplete, or contradictory — always ask for clarifications before proceeding.
- **Recent stable versions**: Always use the most recent stable versions of the relevant libraries and tools. Avoid alpha, beta, and release candidates unless explicitly requested.

## 2. References

- **RTFM**: Read documentation, code, and samples thoroughly, download docs when necessary, use search.
- **Prefer recent docs**: When searching, prioritize results from the current year over older sources.
- **Use available sources**: Explore package-manager caches when you need sources or docs that aren't in the project tree — `nix store`, cargo registry, npm cache, pip wheels, maven/coursier/ivy jars, etc.

## 3. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.
- If the task is a bug fix, the first deliverable is the reproduction, not the fix.

## 4. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 5. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 6. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → (a) write a test (or minimal repro script) that fails because of the bug, (b) verify it fails for the *right* reason — not an unrelated error, (c) implement the fix, (d) verify the same test now passes, (e) verify no other tests regressed. Skipping (a)–(b) is the single most common cause of "fixes" that don't fix anything.
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## 6a. Reproduction Discipline

A "suspected" bug is a hypothesis. A reproduced bug is a fact. Don't ship fixes for hypotheses.

- **Surface the hypothesis**: State in one sentence what you believe is broken and why.
- **Fail first**: The reproduction must fail *before* your fix exists. If you write the fix and the repro together, you don't know which one "worked".
- **Fail for the right reason**: Read the failure message. A test that fails with `ImportError` is not reproducing your `NullPointerException`.
- **When a test is impractical** (race conditions, hardware, external services): write a documented repro — exact commands, inputs, and observed vs expected output. Attach logs. Then propose instrumentation or a narrower test harness before patching blind.
- **If you cannot reproduce**: stop and say so. Ask for more information (logs, repro steps, environment). Do not guess-patch.
- **After the fix**: the repro must now pass, and you must explain *why* the fix addresses the reproduced failure — not just that the test turned green.

## 7. Code Style

- **Type safety**: Encode domain concepts as named types (interfaces/classes/records), avoid catch-all types (Object, any) and untyped containers (string-keyed maps).
- **SOLID**: Adhere to SOLID principles.
- **No globals**: Pass dependencies explicitly via constructors, parameters, or DI containers — never rely on singletons, module-level mutable state, or ambient globals.
- **No magic constants**: Use named constants.
- **No backwards compatibility in internal code**: Refactor freely. External/public APIs follow their own versioning rules (e.g. Baboon model evolution).
- **Composition over conditionals**: Prefer composition over conditional logic.
- **DRY**: Don't repeat yourself — but don't abstract prematurely. Two similar blocks are fine; three means generalize.

## 8. Project Structure

- **New docs**: When creating documentation in projects without an established docs layout, prefer `./docs/drafts/{YYYYMMDD-HHMM}-{name}.md`.
- **Debug scripts**: When creating throwaway debug scripts, prefer `./debug/{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}-{name}.{ext}` (use the appropriate extension for the project language).
- **Services**: Use interface + implementation pattern when possible.
- **Gitignore**: Always create and maintain reasonable `.gitignore` files.

## 9. Tools

- **Debuggers**: Use the debugger appropriate for the language at hand.
- **Parallelism**: Use `nproc` to determine available parallel processes.
- **Nix store discipline — resolve, don't scan**: The store is a flat directory of millions of entries; any recursive walk of the *root* performs a full stat scan that costs minutes even when piped to `head`, and is forbidden. This includes `find /nix/store …` without `-maxdepth 1` (the `-path '*foo*'` form too), `ls -R /nix/store`, and `grep -r /nix/store`. When you need a store path, follow this order and **stop at the first step that answers**: (1) **resolve through the build graph** — `realpath "$(command -v <bin>)"` for an on-PATH binary; `nix eval --raw <flakeref>#<attr>` or `nix path-info <flakeref>#<attr>` for a package out-path; or a known symlink (`~/.nix-profile`, `/run/current-system`). (2) **Match at depth 1** — `ls -d /nix/store/*<name>*` or `find /nix/store -maxdepth 1 -name '*<name>*'`. (3) Only once you hold a concrete top-level path (`/nix/store/<hash>-<name>`) may you descend into *that* subtree (`find /nix/store/<hash>-<name> -maxdepth N …`, `ls`, `cat`). The urge to "just quickly find where X is installed" is exactly the moment to apply step 1 — not to reach for a recursive `find`.
- **Unattended mode**: Always run tools in batch mode, especially tools like SBT which expect user input by default.
- **Worktrees for parallel edits**: When dispatching two or more subagents that will edit the working tree concurrently, give each subagent its own `git worktree` (e.g. `git worktree add ../wt-<task> <branch>`). Two agents writing into the same checkout will clobber each other's edits, corrupt staged changes, and produce a diff that nobody asked for. One worktree per concurrent editor; merge back into the main checkout when each subagent returns. Read-only subagents (review, exploration) can share the main checkout safely. Remove the worktree (`git worktree remove`) once its branch is merged or discarded.
