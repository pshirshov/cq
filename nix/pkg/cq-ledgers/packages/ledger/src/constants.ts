/**
 * Stable constants for the unified-milestones design (msunify cycle).
 *
 * The "milestones" ledger is a bootstrapped, library-managed ledger that
 * holds the canonical list of cross-cutting milestones. Other ledgers
 * reference milestone IDs from it; they do not carry milestone titles
 * or descriptions themselves.
 *
 * - `MILESTONES_LEDGER` — fixed ledger name. The library refuses to
 *   `createLedger` a fresh entry under this name (it bootstraps the
 *   entry itself), and refuses to `archiveMilestone` the active group.
 * - `MILESTONES_ACTIVE_GROUP_ID` — fixed depth-2 group id inside the
 *   milestones ledger. There is exactly one such group; every milestone
 *   item (`M-AMBIENT`, `M1`, `M2`, …) lives inside it.
 * - `MILESTONES_ACTIVE_GROUP_TITLE` — fixed group title; the milestones
 *   ledger's depth-2 header is serialized/parsed as the literal
 *   `## active` (§8d — no id-shaped `## M0 — active`).
 * - `MILESTONES_SCHEMA` — canonical schema. Items use
 *   `status ∈ {open, done, postponed, blocked}` with `done` as the sole
 *   terminal status. Fields are `title`, `description`, `blockedBy`,
 *   `dependsOn` (§8c rename). The latter two are free-form id arrays
 *   (advisory cross-references; no FK enforcement).
