Source auto-init works (H1/H2 refuted by reproduction), so any real 'connection fails' must come from outside the source init path. Leading suspects: (a) VERSION SKEW — the ledger MCP is plugin-registered globally via home-manager/Nix; if that built binary predates the FsLedgerStore.init() auto-create code, it would fail against a fresh dir even though source works (cf. resolved defect D1, also a version-skew 'connection failed'). (b) --cwd resolution to a non-existent/unwritable path. (c) the target directory has no .mcp.json / no ledger server wired at all (then it's 'not configured', not a connection failure). (d) a non-ENOENT fs/permission error under init's mkdir. CANNOT adjudicate without the user's actual error text + how the server is launched — parked on Q37."

This is the divergence path H1's evidence identified as 'the only startup throw' (which we incorrectly set aside after the empty-dir repro).
