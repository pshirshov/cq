- author: user
- session: 994b02a0-7e3f-40df-81ed-b12b9ce6b13e
- question: "Which subagent mechanism should we adopt for Pi: (a) the third-party npm extension `nicobailon/pi-subagents`, (b) badlogic's own example subagent extension shipped in pi-mono's examples/extensions, or (c) a bespoke in-repo Pi extension (nix/pkg/pi-extensions/*.ts via pi.registerTool) purpose-built for the cq flow? Or do you want the plan to start with an evaluation/spike task that compares them and a follow-up to commit the choice?"
- context: "Pi has no native subagents (pi-context.md says so explicitly). The flow needs to dispatch explorers/reviewers/workers. nicobailon/pi-subagents is the closest off-the-shelf match: it already uses agent markdown files with YAML frontmatter (model/tools/skills), /chain + /parallel slash commands, and a 'children do not register the subagent tool' boundary that mirrors our own 'subagents-cannot-spawn-subagents' invariant. The tradeoff is third-party-dependency risk + frontmatter-shape mismatch vs. our existing `mergedAgents` definitions, versus the control (and maintenance cost) of a bespoke extension. This choice determines essentially the entire task breakdown."
- suggestions: ["Adopt nicobailon/pi-subagents (npm package), adapt our agent bundle to its frontmatter","Vendor/port badlogic's example subagent extension into nix/pkg/pi-extensions","Write a bespoke in-repo pi.registerTool extension driven by our existing mergedAgents","First task: spike/compare all three read-only, then a decision item picks one before implementation"]
- recommendation: Start with a short spike comparing nicobailon/pi-subagents against a bespoke extension, but bias toward the bespoke in-repo extension if its frontmatter/dispatch contract diverges from our mergedAgents shape — it keeps the cross-harness dispatch contract under our control and avoids a third-party dependency in the unattended worker path.

- session: 994b02a0-7e3f-40df-81ed-b12b9ce6b13e
- question: "How portable must the cq command prompts (plan/investigate/implement *:advance) be once Pi gains subagents? Should the prompts dispatch subagents through a single harness-agnostic abstraction (so the SAME prompt text works on Claude's Task tool, Codex multi_agent, and Pi), or is it acceptable for the prompts to branch on harness ('if Pi, call the pi-subagents tool; if Claude, use Task')?"
- context: The cq command prompts currently assume Claude Code's native `Task`-tool dispatch and encode rules like 'you never spawn subagents' / 'subagents cannot spawn subagents'. Codex already diverges (features.multi_agent). The portability target dictates whether this goal also requires editing the shared command prompts in nix/pkg/cq-assets, or only adds a Pi-side adapter that maps the existing dispatch convention onto Pi's mechanism. This is load-bearing for scope (touch shared prompts vs Pi-only).
- suggestions: ["Single harness-agnostic dispatch abstraction; minimize/avoid harness-specific branches in prompts","Pi-side adapter only: keep prompts as-is, the Pi mechanism interprets the existing dispatch convention","Explicit per-harness branches in the prompts are acceptable"]
- recommendation: Prefer a Pi-side adapter that interprets the EXISTING dispatch convention (the agent name + task the prompt already specifies), so the shared command prompts stay unchanged and Claude/Codex are unaffected; only fall back to prompt edits if the convention can't be expressed Pi-side.
- ledgerRefs: ["goals:G28"]
- answer: I would prefer these prompts to work unchanged in all harnesses

- author: user
- session: 994b02a0-7e3f-40df-81ed-b12b9ce6b13e
- question: Which model/provider should Pi subagents run under, and does each cq subagent role's `suggestedModel` tier (frontier/standard/fast) need to map to a concrete Pi provider+model? Pi's default is grok-build, but the cq agents carry Claude-oriented model hints.
- context: Under Claude Code each subagent inherits a Claude model; the cq agent definitions and task `suggestedModel` tiers assume that resolution. Pi can route to grok-build, openrouter, ollama-cloud, minimax, anthropic-OAuth, etc. (see programs.pi packages). A subagent extension typically lets an agent's frontmatter pin a model. We need to know whether Pi subagents should (a) all inherit the parent's active Pi model, (b) map our frontier/standard/fast tiers to specific Pi providers, or (c) be left to the chosen extension's defaults. This affects whether the plan must add a tier->Pi-model mapping.
- suggestions: ["Subagents inherit the parent Pi session's active model (simplest)","Map frontier/standard/fast tiers to specific Pi providers+models (e.g. frontier=grok-build or anthropic, fast=ollama/minimax)","Defer to the chosen extension's per-agent frontmatter defaults"]
- recommendation: Have subagents inherit the parent Pi model for the first iteration (least new config, matches how Claude subagents inherit), and defer a tier->provider mapping to a follow-up unless you already want cost/latency tiering on day one.
- ledgerRefs: ["goals:G28"]
- answer: Essentially, it orchestrator should be able to specify which agents it wants to run. Also we need specific fast-standard-frontier mapping defined in cq.toml

- author: user
- session: 994b02a0-7e3f-40df-81ed-b12b9ce6b13e
- question: "What is the acceptance/verification bar for this goal — how do we prove Pi subagents 'work correctly, mirroring Claude Code'? Specifically, which cq flow(s) must run end-to-end under Pi as the success criterion (e.g. a full /cq:plan:advance round dispatching candidate planners, or /cq:investigate:advance dispatching read-only explorers, or /cq:implement:advance dispatching workers+reviewers), and on what target repo?"
- context: Per operationalism, 'works correctly under pi' needs a concrete, observable test. The cq flow uses subagents in distinct shapes per phase (read-only explorers in investigate, candidate planners + reviewers in plan, isolated-worktree workers + reviewers in implement). Knowing the minimum demonstrable flow (and whether it must run unattended in the yolo/bubblewrap sandbox) sets each task's `acceptance` field and bounds scope.
- suggestions: ["A single phase end-to-end under Pi is sufficient acceptance (name which)","All three phases (plan/investigate/implement) must dispatch subagents successfully under Pi","Just the dispatch primitive working (spawn a child, get a structured result back) is enough; full-flow validation is a follow-up"]
- recommendation: "Make the acceptance bar: one read-only explorer dispatch (investigate-style) AND one reviewer dispatch (plan-review-style) complete under Pi and return a parseable result, demonstrated on THIS repo in the normal (non-sandboxed) environment first; full unattended-sandbox + implement-worker validation as a follow-up goal."

- author: user
- session: 994b02a0-7e3f-40df-81ed-b12b9ce6b13e
- question: If we adopt an npm-distributed extension (e.g. nicobailon/pi-subagents), is adding it to programs.pi.settings.packages (Pi's managed --legacy-peer-deps npm install on first run) acceptable, or must it be vendored/pinned into the Nix store like the codex-plugin-cc and pi-extensions are, for reproducibility on the unattended llm-worker hosts?
- context: The existing Pi packages (rpiv-web-tools, pi-anthropic-auth, pi-ollama-cloud, minimax, pi-xai) are installed from npm at first run, NOT pinned in Nix — but the comments note self-containedness constraints around Pi's loader/jiti alias map. A subagent extension that spawns child Pi sessions and reads agent markdown is more load-bearing for the flow than a provider shim, so reproducibility/pinning policy matters. This determines whether a packaging task (vendor + FOD hash, like pkg/pi-coding-agent) is in scope.
- suggestions: ["npm install via programs.pi.settings.packages is fine (matches existing providers)","Must be vendored/pinned in the Nix store for unattended-host reproducibility","Prefer a local extension (nix/pkg/pi-extensions/*.ts) precisely to avoid the npm-pinning question"]
- recommendation: If we go with a third-party extension, vendor+pin it in the Nix store (it is load-bearing for the flow on unattended hosts); if that vendoring cost is high, that is itself an argument for the bespoke local nix/pkg/pi-extensions approach from Q1.
- ledgerRefs: ["goals:G28"]
- answer: If we use a third party extension there is no need to vendor it BUT I'm biased towards custom extension - because we will need one later for a determenistic logic governing the orchestrating session

- question: "Mechanism lock-in (re Q125 counter-question): given the now-fixed constraints — Q126 the shared cq command prompts must work UNCHANGED across harnesses (Pi-side adapter only, interpreting the existing dispatch convention), Q127 the orchestrator must be able to name which agent to run and the fast/standard/frontier tiers must resolve via a cq.toml mapping to concrete Pi provider+model pairs, Q128 acceptance = one read-only explorer dispatch + one reviewer dispatch returning a parseable result on THIS repo non-sandboxed, and Q129 no Nix-vendoring requirement plus your stated bias toward a bespoke in-repo extension (also needed later for deterministic orchestration-session logic) — which subagent mechanism do we lock for Pi: (a) third-party npm `nicobailon/pi-subagents`, (b) vendor/port badlogic's example subagent extension, or (c) a bespoke in-repo `nix/pkg/pi-extensions` `pi.registerTool` extension? Full grounded pros/cons/difficulty/downsides analysis is in the context field below."
- context: |
    EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS (read-only grounding this round; opus-4.8[1m]).
    
    === What the mechanism must actually do (derived from the repo, not assumed) ===
    The cq commands already encode a PER-HARNESS dispatch split, not a single abstraction. In nix/pkg/cq-assets/commands/cq/investigate/advance.md (L42-44) and implement/advance.md the convention is literally: 'Claude -> dispatch via the Agent tool with subagent_type: "<agent-name>" (+ isolation: "worktree"); Codex -> native multi_agent + manual git worktree add/remove'. There is currently NO Pi branch. The agents are named markdown files at nix/pkg/cq-assets/agents/<name>.md (plan-advance, plan-reviewer, investigate-explorer/-prober, implement-worker/-reviewer/-conflict-resolver) carrying `name` / `description` / `disallowedTools` frontmatter; dev-llm.nix materializes them into Claude via programs.claude-code.agents (-> ~/.claude/agents/<name>.md) but does NOT project them to Pi at all (programs.pi consumes only commands as promptTemplates + skills). So under Pi, every dispatch step has no runtime mechanism. The Pi mechanism must therefore: (1) be invokable in a way the EXISTING prompt text already says (the prompt names an agent + a task + sometimes isolation:worktree), (2) read the mergedAgents markdown for that name (its description + disallowedTools), (3) spawn a child Pi session with the agent's tools filtered + a resolved model, (4) enforce subagents-cannot-spawn-subagents (the child must NOT see the dispatch tool), and (5) return a structured, parseable result to the parent (the orchestrator parses explorer evidence-json / reviewer verdict-json).
    
    === How hard is a bespoke extension, concretely? (the user's direct question) ===
    The in-repo extension API is compact and already proven. The two existing extensions are the evidence: patch-grok-build-context-window.ts (~75 lines) and drop-client-web-search-for-grok.ts (~40 lines). They show the whole surface we need: `export default function(pi: ExtensionAPI)`, `pi.on("session_start"|"before_provider_request", handler)`, `pi.registerProvider(...)`, payload inspection/mutation, and event ordering guarantees. A subagent extension additionally needs `pi.registerTool` (register one tool, e.g. dispatch_agent({agent, task})) and the ability to run a child Pi turn with a filtered toolset + chosen model. Loading is one line in programs.pi.settings.extensions (a store path), exactly like the two existing ones. Realistic size: a single TS file on the order of 150-300 lines (tool registration + read agent markdown + spawn child session with filtered tools + resolved model + return structured result), NOT a package. The hard/uncertain part is NOT the cq-side glue — it is the child-session spawning primitive: we must confirm Pi's ExtensionAPI exposes a supported way to run an isolated child agent turn (its own context, filtered tools) and capture its final output. That is the ONE thing to de-risk; badlogic's example extension and nicobailon/pi-subagents BOTH already do exactly this, which is direct proof the primitive exists in this Pi version — we would lift the spawning technique from them even if we don't depend on them.
    
    === Option (a) nicobailon/pi-subagents (npm) ===
    Pros: closest off-the-shelf fit; already does isolated child sessions, agent-markdown-with-YAML-frontmatter (model/tools/skills), /chain + /parallel slash commands, AND a 'children do not register the subagent tool' boundary that mirrors our subagents-cannot-spawn-subagents invariant. Cons measured against the fixed constraints: (i) Q126 — its dispatch surface is /chain + /parallel slash commands and its OWN frontmatter shape, which is NOT the convention our shared prompts speak (Agent tool + subagent_type + isolation:worktree). To make the prompts work unchanged we would STILL need an adapter that maps our convention onto its tool, so we don't actually avoid writing in-repo glue — we add a third-party dep ON TOP of glue. (ii) Frontmatter mismatch vs our mergedAgents (name/description/disallowedTools) means either rewriting our agents to its schema or writing a shim — friction either way. (iii) Q129 — you explicitly do NOT want to depend on it long-term and it CANNOT host the future deterministic orchestration-session logic. (iv) third-party maintenance/version risk on the load-bearing worker path. No vendoring required per Q129, but the dependency itself is the objection.
    
    === Option (b) vendor/port badlogic's example extension ===
    Pros: first-party badlogic example (isolated-context child sessions, filtered tools) — a clean, minimal reference and the most authoritative proof of the spawning primitive. Cons: it is an EXAMPLE, not a maintained package, so adopting it = porting it into nix/pkg/pi-extensions anyway (i.e. it collapses into option (c) with a head start). Same Q126 adapter work needed (it isn't built around our convention). Net: best treated as a CODE REFERENCE for option (c), not a separate adopt-able mechanism.
    
    === Option (c) bespoke in-repo pi.registerTool extension (RECOMMENDED) ===
    Pros: (i) Q126 — we own the dispatch contract, so we register a tool whose call shape matches what the shared prompts ALREADY say (agent name + task [+ isolation]); prompts stay byte-for-byte unchanged and Claude/Codex are untouched. (ii) Q127 — naturally supports orchestrator-named agents (the tool takes the agent name) and a tier->provider mapping: cq.toml already parses an [aliases] table (harness/model) via the ledger config layer; we add a [tiers] (fast/standard/frontier -> alias-or-provider+model) mapping and the extension resolves suggestedModel through it. (iii) Q129 — it is the SAME extension surface (nix/pkg/pi-extensions/*.ts, pi.registerTool/registerProvider) we will need for the future deterministic orchestration-session logic, so the investment compounds. (iv) no third-party dependency on the unattended worker path. Cons/downsides (stated honestly): we own the child-session lifecycle (spawn, tool-filtering, result capture, error handling) and its maintenance; we carry the risk if Pi's ExtensionAPI child-session surface changes across Pi bumps (mitigated: only this one extension breaks, and the two existing extensions show bumps are manageable); and we must first DE-RISK the child-session spawning primitive (a tiny spike reading badlogic's example + Pi's coding-agent extension API) before committing the task breakdown. That spike is the single genuine unknown.
    
    === RECOMMENDATION ===
    Lock option (c), the bespoke in-repo nix/pkg/pi-extensions extension, with badlogic's example used as a code reference for the child-session spawning primitive. Justification: the three fixed constraints all point the same way — Q126 (prompts unchanged) and Q127 (orchestrator-named agent + cq.toml tier mapping) are most directly satisfied by a tool WE shape to the existing convention; Q129 (no-vendor bias + future deterministic-orchestration extension) makes the in-repo extension the reusable foundation rather than a throwaway. The only real cost is owning the child-session lifecycle + one de-risking spike of the spawning primitive, which is bounded and which options (a)/(b) prove is achievable. If the spike reveals Pi's ExtensionAPI cannot spawn a filtered-tool child session at all, that single finding would reopen this choice toward (a)/(b) — so the first planned task should be that read-only spike with a go/no-go on the primitive.
- suggestions: ["(a) Adopt third-party npm nicobailon/pi-subagents (no vendoring per Q129) + an adapter mapping our dispatch convention onto its tool, and reshape agent frontmatter to its schema","(b) Vendor/port badlogic's example subagent extension into nix/pkg/pi-extensions (collapses into option c with a head start)","(c) RECOMMENDED: bespoke in-repo nix/pkg/pi-extensions pi.registerTool extension shaped to the existing dispatch convention, reading mergedAgents + resolving suggestedModel via a new cq.toml [tiers] mapping, using badlogic's example as a spawning-primitive reference"]
- recommendation: "Lock (c) the bespoke in-repo extension. It is the only option that satisfies Q126 (shared prompts unchanged — we shape the tool to the existing Agent/subagent_type convention), Q127 (orchestrator names the agent; fast/standard/frontier resolve via a new cq.toml [tiers] mapping the config layer already supports alongside [aliases]), and Q129 (no third-party worker-path dependency, and it IS the extension surface the future deterministic orchestration-session logic will reuse). Implementation difficulty is moderate and bounded: ~150-300 lines in one TS file using the same ExtensionAPI the two existing pi-extensions already use; the single real unknown is whether Pi's ExtensionAPI can spawn a filtered-tool child session and capture its result — which badlogic's example and nicobailon/pi-subagents both prove it can. The honest downside is that we own the child-session lifecycle and its maintenance across Pi version bumps. Recommend the first planned task be a read-only spike confirming that spawning primitive (go/no-go), after which the rest of the breakdown is committed."
