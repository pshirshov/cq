 *
 * Authored DIRECTLY from `cq-assets/agents/investigate-prober.md` — its
 * `## Catalogue` block:
 *
 * - **Input** — the hypothesis id `H` and statement (verbatim), the
 *   `probeRequest { what, why }` the explorer raised (what to run and why it
 *   settles H), the branch context (incl. the base commit/branch for the
 *   throwaway worktree), and optional specific leads.
 *
 * - **Output** — the evidence block `{ hypothesisId, evidence[], lean, notes? }`
 *   — the SAME shape the explorer returns BUT WITHOUT `probeRequest` (the prober
 *   executes; it does not escalate further). `lean` is one of
 *   `supports | contradicts | mixed | insufficient`.
