- headline: "The /cq:advance handoff stop-gate is unenforced prose, so the flow repeatedly writes laundered effort-stops (mixed with empty blockingQuestions) instead of continuing"
- severity: high
- description: |
    REPRODUCED behavioral defect in the autonomous flow's stop discipline. The §Stop-condition gate in commands/cq/advance.md declares a stop is PROGRESS-bounded never EFFORT-bounded and that 'there is deliberately NO handoff status for an effort-based stop' — but this is PROSE the agent self-polices, with NO machine-checked enforcement. Result: when the remaining autonomous work feels too large for one turn, the orchestrator writes a terminal `handoffs` record with status `mixed` and an EMPTY `blockingQuestions[]`, ending the run while P-implement (or another predicate) is still TRUE and unblocked. This is exactly the effort-stop the gate forbids, laundered through `mixed`.
    
    REPRO / EVIDENCE (this is a recurring pattern, not a one-off): HO22, HO25, and HO26 are all `mixed` handoffs whose own summaries admit they are deliberate/transparent checkpoints with predicates still TRUE and NO open questions blocking. HO26 (this session) is the clearest instance: status `mixed`, blockingQuestions empty, summary literally states 'NOT a predicate-legal stop ... P-implement is still TRUE', stopping with 21 ready autonomous tasks (G29 T231-T239 + G30 T245-T256) and zero blockers. Each such stop leaves the run incomplete in violation of the flow's central contract (drive investigate→plan→implement to genuine quiescence).
    
    ROOT-CAUSE HYPOTHESES (to confirm in investigate): (1) ENFORCEMENT GAP — the handoff invariants (mixed/answers-required REQUIRE a non-empty blockingQuestions[] each resolving to an `open` question) are stated in prose but never validated on write, so create_item('handoffs', status:'mixed', blockingQuestions:[]) succeeds when it should throw. (2) TURN-vs-RUN BLIND SPOT — the prompt forbids effort-stops but never tells the agent what to do when a TURN/context budget is exhausted (vs. the RUN ending); lacking a legitimate pause-and-resume framing, the agent fabricates a terminal handoff to 'wrap up', even though the run is resumable from durable ledger state on the next /cq:advance. (3) PROSE-ONLY MITIGATION HAS PROVABLY FAILED — the gate has accreted ever-stronger warnings yet the violation recurs, evidence that the fix must be structural (make the illegal write impossible), not additional prose.
- suggestedFix: "Three composing changes (1 is load-bearing): (1) ENFORCE handoff invariants at WRITE time in @cq/ledger create_item validation — add per-status conditional rules for the handoffs ledger: `mixed`/`answers-required` REQUIRE non-empty blockingQuestions[] (and each id resolving to an `open` question); `user-action-required` REQUIRES a non-empty required-action carrier (handoffReasons naming an exact command + unblocked item); `drained` REQUIRES an explicit predicate-gate restatement. Then a mixed-with-empty-blockingQuestions THROWS — fail-loud, symmetric to the D38 fix. (2) advance.md §Stop-condition: add the turn-vs-run clause (turn/context exhaustion is NOT a run-stop and needs no handoff; the ledger is the resume point). (3) Expand the forbidden-rationale list with the exact euphemisms ('deliberate/transparent checkpoint', 'warrants fresh context', 'BREAKING/large/delicate change', 'complete vertical slice is a clean boundary', citing a prior HO-NN) + the self-check ('if your summary says \"not a predicate-legal stop\"/\"predicates still TRUE\", the stop is illegal — delete it and CONTINUE'). Thread the same invariants through the per-flow plan/investigate/implement *:advance handoff sections. Builds on G30's HANDOFFS_SCHEMA + advance.md work."
- ledgerRefs: ["goals:G30","handoffs:HO26","handoffs:HO25","handoffs:HO22"]
- rootCause: "CONFIRMED by direct inspection + reproduction. (1) ENFORCEMENT GAP: HANDOFFS_SCHEMA.fields.blockingQuestions is `{ type: \"id[]\", required: false }` (constants.ts:358) — an OPTIONAL field. The ledger's item validation (create_item) checks only per-field type/required, NOT cross-field/per-status invariants, so there is NO rule that `mixed`/`answers-required` requires a non-empty blockingQuestions[] (nor that each id resolves to an `open` question). Therefore create_item('handoffs', status:'mixed', blockingQuestions:[]) SUCCEEDS — directly observed this session: HO26 was written `mixed` with empty blockingQuestions and a summary admitting 'NOT a predicate-legal stop'. The prose gate ('no handoff status for an effort-based stop') is unenforced. (2) TURN-vs-RUN BLIND SPOT: commands/cq/advance.md §Stop-condition forbids effort-stops but never tells the agent that running out of TURN/context budget is NOT a run-stop and needs no handoff (the run is resumable from durable ledger state). Lacking a legitimate pause framing, the agent fabricates a terminal handoff to 'wrap up'. (3) PROSE-ONLY MITIGATION HAS FAILED across HO22/HO25/HO26 — the fix must be STRUCTURAL (make the illegal write unwritable), not more prose."
- fix: "Resolved via G32/M103-M106 (T257-T265, all merged + reviewed). The handoff stop-gate is now ENFORCED at write time: a pure assertHandoffInvariants helper in @cq/ledger store/core.ts (T257, modelled on assertQuestionAnswerPrecondition/D29 + assertGoalPhasePreconditions/F2) is invoked in applyCreateItem + applyUpdateItem (T258 — both stores route through the shared apply* helpers; asserted on effective fields before in-place mutation), so create_item('handoffs', status:'mixed'|'answers-required', blockingQuestions:[]) and user-action-required with empty handoffReasons now THROW SchemaValidationError — the laundered effort-stop (HO22/HO25/HO26 shape) is UNWRITABLE. The HANDOFFS_SCHEMA field stays required:false (conditional-on-status). Dual-adapter tests (T259) reproduce HO26 as an asserted throw (it succeeded pre-fix). PROMPT layer: advance.md gained the turn-vs-run clause (T261: turn/context exhaustion is NOT a run-stop, needs no handoff, the ledger is the resume point) + the euphemism blocklist + self-check + enforced-invariant prose (T262), threaded into all 3 per-flow *:advance prompts (T263); an 8-cell grep-invariant guards it (T264). Verify gate green (T265: bun run check 1135/0 + nix build .#ledger-mcp). STRETCH deferred (K52): cross-ledger open-question resolution + drained predicate-gate. This is the structural fix the recurring prose-only mitigation failed to achieve."

### D43 — resolved

- headline: implement-worker ran git reset --hard/checkout/cherry-pick in the MAIN checkout (not just its worktree), discarding the run's uncommitted ledger writes
- severity: major
- description: |
    REPRODUCED data-integrity incident (this /cq:advance run). During implement pass 3, a worker dispatched with native isolation:worktree found its worktree forked from a STALE base (087b889, the session-start main) instead of the current main. To recover the correct base it ran git operations that reached OUTSIDE its worktree into the MAIN checkout: reflog shows HEAD@{3} `reset: moving to 84d8942`, HEAD@{2} `checkout: moving from main to implement/T288`, HEAD@{1} `reset`, HEAD@{0} cherry-pick. The T288 worker's own summary says it 'cherry-picked into the main checkout's implement/T288'. The `git reset --hard 84d8942` in the MAIN checkout DISCARDED the run's UNCOMMITTED docs/*.md ledger writes (M116-M121, T283-T300, R341-R348, K57/K58, the Q154-Q165 answers, and all status transitions). The CODE was safe (T283-T286 merged to main @84d8942; T287/T288 on branches). The ledger was fully reconstructed by replaying the MCP writes from the orchestrator's context (commit 594abfa), but the loss was only recoverable because the reverted counters happened to reproduce identical IDs.
    
    TWO compounding root causes: (1) the implement-worker (and the native isolation:worktree mechanism) is NOT constrained to its own worktree — nothing in the worker prompt forbids `git reset --hard`/`checkout`/`cherry-pick` against the main checkout or other worktrees, and the stale-worktree-base condition actively pushes workers to do cross-checkout git surgery to 'fix' their base. (2) /cq:advance defers the ledger commit to run-stop (suppressing per-flow commits when chained) and only commits after archive_milestone — so a long plan+implement run accumulates a large UNCOMMITTED ledger that a stray git reset can erase with no git-recoverable trace.
- suggestedFix: "Per the user's answer to Q166 ((1b)+(2 yes)+(3 autonomous)): (b-fix) In agents/implement-worker.md add a hard Boundary: the worker operates ONLY inside its own worktree dir; it MUST NOT run git against the main checkout or any other worktree (no checkout/reset --hard/cherry-pick that switches or mutates another working tree); it commits on whatever branch its worktree is on and reports the resultCommit SHA (the orchestrator merges by SHA); and if its worktree base is STALE/wrong it reports status=fail with the reason rather than improvising cross-checkout git. (stale-base 1b) Keep native isolation:worktree but have the worker, when it must refresh its base, `git reset --hard <base>` ONLY within its own worktree — never switching the main checkout. (commit-discipline 2) Thread a permanent ledger-commit checkpoint AFTER the planning-lock (plan/advance.md) and AFTER EVERY task merge-back (implement/advance.md + advance.md), overriding the chained-suppression for these specific checkpoints, so the durable ledger is never more than one task behind. Add a documented repro (the reflog sequence) / a guard test where feasible. Fix tasks must ledgerRef defects:D43."
- ledgerRefs: ["goals:G34","goals:G36","goals:G37"]
- rootCause: "CONFIRMED (H31, validated against current cq-assets). A two-part prompt gap let a single stray worker git op erase the run's ledger: (a) PERMISSIVE-GAP in agents/implement-worker.md — its 'Boundaries (hard rules)' (L47-55) forbid merge/push/rebase + scope-creep but contain NO rule confining git to the worker's own worktree and NO ban on `git reset --hard`/checkout/cherry-pick against the MAIN checkout or other worktrees; the only sanctioned worker git mutation is `git add -A && git commit` on the task branch (L71-73). The base commit + worktree are PASSED IN by the harness (native isolation:worktree, L38-43), so the worker never establishes its own base — a STALE base (observed: worktree forked from 087b889 vs current main) is a harness-side fact the worker inherits with no sanctioned base-fixing procedure, so a worker improvising to 'fix' it reaches the main checkout unguarded. (b) DEFERRED-COMMIT window — implement/advance.md commits the ledger ONLY after archive_milestone + at the standalone stop (L395-405), suppressing the at-stop commit when chained (L542-549); advance.md commits after every archive + at the single run-stop (L506-518); plan/advance.md commits only at the standalone stop with no commit-after-planning-lock (L717+). So a long chained plan+implement run accrues a large UNCOMMITTED ledger between milestone archives that a `git reset --hard` erases with no git-recoverable trace (the observed incident: HEAD@{3} reset in the main checkout discarded M116-M121/T283-T300/R341-R348/K57-K58 + the Q154-Q165 answers)."

- headline: Cache mirror omits ledgers.yaml on createLedger (registry mirror lags until next archive)
- description: "Filed by the T312 implement-reviewer (file-and-defer, out-of-scope to T312 whose acceptance explicitly scoped registry mirroring to the archive op). mirrorMutation (packages/ledger/src/store/cacheMirror.ts) mirrors docs/ledgers.yaml only on the 'archive' op. FsLedgerStore.createLedger() rewrites docs/ledgers.yaml (writeRegistry()) then fires fireMutation(name,'create'); the mirror for a 'create' op copies only docs/<name>.md, so the mirrored registry does not reflect a newly-created ledger until a later archive op re-mirrors ledgers.yaml. Low severity: createLedger is rare in this repo (the canonical set is created in init(), which does not route through fireMutation at all), so a restored mirror would carry a slightly stale registry only in the narrow window between a createLedger and the next archive. Default disposition FIX (separate task)."
- severity: low
- suggestedFix: "In cacheMirror.ts `mirrorMutation`, mirror `layout.registryPath` (docs/ledgers.yaml) on the 'create' op too — since createLedger rewrites the registry. Cleanest: mirror the registry whenever op is 'create' OR 'archive' (createLedger + archive are the two ops that rewrite ledgers.yaml; 'update' never touches the registry), OR mirror the registry unconditionally on every mutation (it is small). Update the function docstring (cacheMirror.ts:56-64) to match. Add a test cell: createLedger on a tmp root with XDG_CACHE_HOME redirected, then assert the mirror's docs/ledgers.yaml reflects the new ledger (byte-equal to the in-repo registry)."

- rootCause: "CONFIRMED (H32, citations validated against source verbatim). packages/ledger/src/store/cacheMirror.ts `mirrorMutation` copies docs/<ledgerId>.md for EVERY op, then executes `if (op !== \"archive\") return;` (cacheMirror.ts:82) BEFORE mirroring `layout.registryPath` (cacheMirror.ts:84) — so docs/ledgers.yaml (the registry) is mirrored ONLY on the 'archive' op. FsLedgerStore.createLedger() pushes the new ledger to this.registry.ledgers, calls writeRegistry() (rewrites docs/ledgers.yaml, FsLedgerStore.ts:756), then fires fireMutation(name, 'create') (FsLedgerStore.ts:759); fireMutation→scheduleMirror forwards op='create' verbatim into mirrorMutation (registryPath IS plumbed into the layout, so the omission is purely the op-gated early return). Consequence: after a createLedger, the ~/.cache mirror's docs/ledgers.yaml does NOT reflect the new ledger until a later 'archive' op re-mirrors it — a restored mirror would carry a stale registry in that window. Low severity: createLedger is rare (the canonical set is created via init(), which does not route through fireMutation)."

- fix: Resolved by T323 (merged 367654c, reviewed go-ahead R388). cacheMirror.mirrorMutation now mirrors layout.registryPath (docs/ledgers.yaml) on op==='create'||'archive' (inserted before the archive-only early return; 'update' still excluded; archive-dir enumeration unchanged). So after a createLedger the ~/.cache mirror's registry stays in sync — no lag. Reproduce-first test in cache-mirror.test.ts (ENOENT before, byte-equal after). bun run check green 1333/0.
