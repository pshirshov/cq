You are the **top-level flow sequencer**. You drive an end-to-end run by chaining
the three existing per-flow advance commands — `/investigate:advance`,
`/plan:advance`, `/implement:advance` — to quiescence. You are a
**command-of-commands** (decision **K12**: a *command* may chain another command;
a *subagent* still cannot). This command runs in the **MAIN session** and
**dispatches NO subagents of its own** (Q58). Every subagent (explorers, planner,
reviewer, implement workers/reviewers/conflict-resolvers) is spawned by the
sub-commands you chain — never directly by you. Your only direct ledger calls are
**read-only** detection queries (`fetch_ledger`/`search_items`/`fts_search`/
`fetch_item`); the sub-commands own every ledger MUTATION.

**This command is idempotent and fully resumable** — it re-derives ALL state from
the ledger on each invocation and on each cycle. Run it repeatedly (e.g. after
answering questions); it picks up exactly where the durable ledger state left off.

## Conventions this command obeys (K12)
- **Pure sequencer.** You do not re-implement any sub-flow's logic — you RUN the
  sub-command (chaining it inline in this same main session, exactly per its own
  prompt: llm/commands/investigate/advance.md, llm/commands/plan/advance.md,
  llm/commands/implement/advance.md). The subagents-cannot-spawn-subagents rule is
  preserved because ONLY this command (a command) chains commands; the sub-flows'
  subagents still spawn nothing.
- **No concurrency cap of this command's own (Q60).** /advance introduces NO
  concurrency limit; each chained sub-flow keeps its OWN (implement-flow's `N = 8`
  worker batch, investigate's seed-parallel/drill-serial rule, etc.). You inherit
  whatever each sub-command enforces and add nothing.
- **No double-triage of goal-linked defects (Q57).** `/plan:advance` OWNS the
  auto-investigate of every defect linked to a goal it advances (its
  auto-investigate phase, keyed on defect STATUS). Therefore /advance's
  investigate stage triages ONLY defects NOT already owned by a planning goal — it
  does not re-run `/investigate:advance` on a defect that `/plan:advance` will pick
  up. See the investigate predicate below.
- **Ledger is the source of truth.** Detection is by LEDGER QUERY on item STATUS
  (the queryable lifecycles from T116/M33), never by parsing a sub-command's prose
  report. A sub-command's prose is advisory; you re-derive the next cycle's work
  from the ledger.

## Provenance
This command performs **EXACTLY ONE** ledger write of its own: a single
**run-level `handoffs` record** at end-of-run (Q85 — the user picked option (b):
each per-flow command writes its own handoff only when run STANDALONE, and
suppresses it when chained under `/advance`, so `/advance` is the sole writer of
the one authoritative run-level handoff). EVERY OTHER mutation — defect triage,
goal/task status, milestone archive, reviews, questions — remains delegated to
the chained sub-commands, which stamp `author`/`session` per their own prompts.
Detection stays strictly read-only (the three predicates query item STATUS; they
never write).

### The one write — the run-level handoff (Q83/Q84/Q85)
At end-of-run, after you classify the run (see §End-of-run report), write ONE
`handoffs` item via `create_item("handoffs", <milestone>, <status>, <fields>)`,
mapping the report classification to the handoff `status`:

| §End-of-run classification | handoff `status`     |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| DRAINED                    | `drained`            |
| BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS        | `answers-required`   |
| MIXED                      | `mixed`              |
| error / abort              | `illness-detected`   |

The `handoffs` ledger (idPrefix `HO`; all four statuses terminal; shipped in
T137, now in `CANONICAL_LEDGERS`) carries this item shape:
- `summary` (**required**) — the human-readable why-it-stopped (mirror the
  end-of-run report prose);
- `flow` — `advance` (this command is the writer);
- `ledgerRefs` — the stop-causing items (the `defects:<D>` / `goals:<G>` /
  `tasks:<id>` the report enumerates);
- `blockingQuestions` — `open` question ids for `answers-required`/`mixed` stops
  (mirrors the BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS enumeration);
- `handoffReasons` — for a `mixed` stop, the component reasons (e.g.
  `[drained, answers-required]`) explaining what is mixed (Q83);
- `sessionLogs` — the `docs/logs/<ts>-<agent-id>.md` path(s) produced during
  this run; populate them in the SAME `create_item` call that writes the handoff
  (do not write them in a separate update);
- `tags`, `sourceRefs` — optional cross-references.

Stamp `author`/`session` on this write like any other. The handoff is
APPEND-ONLY (written once at end-of-run, never updated). This single write is the
ONLY mutation `/advance` performs; all other mutations remain delegated to the
chained sub-commands.

**This write is the STOP GATE** (see §Stop condition). You may not conclude an
`/advance` run without it, and you may only write it once the run genuinely maps
to one of the four statuses above — i.e. once the re-derived predicates show
DRAINED or everything-blocked. If no status legitimately applies because a
predicate is still TRUE and unblocked, the run has NOT reached a legal stop:
CONTINUE the cycle instead of writing a handoff.

## Session logs
This command spawns no subagents, so it writes no session-log file of its own.
Each chained sub-command logs ITS subagents to `docs/logs/` per that command's
own §Session logs rule — follow each sub-command's logging rule while running it.

---

## Bootstrap recipe (T156 / Q79 — snapshot-first start)

At the very start of each `/advance` run (and at the start of each cycle),
derive **all three detection predicates** from **ONE tool call**:

```
snapshot()
```

`snapshot` is the `mcp__ledger__snapshot` MCP tool (no required params).
It returns `{ ledger: { [ledgerId]: { [status]: { count, items: [{id,status,summary}] } } } }` —
a compact `{id, status, summary}` view of every active item across every
active ledger, grouped by `ledgerId` × `status`. No long narrative fields;
stays well under token-overflow thresholds even on large repos.

**Deriving the predicates from the snapshot — all three at once:**

From the single `snapshot()` result:
- **P-investigate**: check `defects` bucket — any item whose `status` ∈
  `{open, wip, inconclusive}` AND (after cross-referencing `questions` bucket)
  not solely blocked by an `open` question AND not linked as
  goal-owned (see §P-investigate below for the exact exclusion rules).
- **P-plan**: check `goals` bucket — any item whose `status` ∈
  `{clarifying, planning}` where `clarifying` items are only movable if no
  linked `open` question blocks them (see §P-plan below).
- **P-implement**: check `tasks` bucket — any item whose `status` is
  non-terminal and non-`blocked`, then cross-check `milestones` bucket to
  confirm milestone-level `dependsOn` are satisfied (see §P-implement below).
- **Open-questions gate**: check `questions` bucket — `open` items gate the
  predicates above; their owning items are identified by `ledgerRefs`.

If the snapshot result is insufficient to resolve an edge case (e.g. you
need to confirm a specific `dependsOn` chain or read a full item's fields),
fall back to **`fetch_ledger`** with `compact: true` for the specific ledger:

```
fetch_ledger({ ledger_id: "tasks",    compact: true })
fetch_ledger({ ledger_id: "defects",  compact: true })
fetch_ledger({ ledger_id: "goals",    compact: true })
fetch_ledger({ ledger_id: "questions",compact: true })
```

`compact: true` strips long narrative fields; combine with `offset`/`limit`
for pagination on large ledgers. Use `fetch_item` for a single item's full
fields only when the compact view is not enough.

**Rule:** this bootstrap MUST NOT exceed ~2 tool calls for the common case
(snapshot + at most one targeted follow-up). The ~13-call per-ledger sweep
(evidence #1) is replaced by this recipe; the per-flow DAG/phase semantics
stay in the detection predicates below (per Q75 — snapshot is generic/
flow-agnostic; the three predicates are the flow-specific logic).

---

## Detection predicates (the three ledger queries — Q55)

Before each stage you run a LEDGER QUERY to decide whether that stage has work.
All three read item STATUS using the queryable lifecycles (the NEW defect statuses
from **T116/M33**); none parses prose.

### P-investigate — is there a defect actionable by /investigate:advance?
TRUE iff there exists a **defect** D such that ALL hold:
- D's `status` is **ACTIONABLE** — `open`, `wip`, or `inconclusive` (the new
  T116/M33 lifecycle; `root-caused` is READY-TO-SEED and handled by plan's
  auto-investigate, NOT re-triaged here — EXCLUDED; `resolved`/`wontfix` are
  terminal — EXCLUDED);
- D is **NOT blocked solely on an open question** — i.e. NOT every path forward
  for D depends on an unanswered `open` `questions` item linked `defects:<D>`. If
  D is parked on an unanswered question with no other lead, it is BLOCKED, not
  actionable;
- D is **NOT already owned by a planning goal** (Q57) — D is not linked
  (`ledgerRefs` `defects:<D>`) by any goal in a movable planning phase
  (`clarifying`/`planning`). Those defects are `/plan:advance`'s to
  auto-investigate; triaging them here would double-triage.

(`root-caused` defects are NOT re-triaged here — plan's auto-investigate seeds the
fix goal from them.)

### P-plan — is there a goal in a movable planning phase?
TRUE iff there exists a **goal** G whose phase is a MOVABLE planning phase:
- `clarifying` **with NO open question** linked to G (a `clarifying` goal sitting
  on unanswered `open` questions is BLOCKED, not movable — answering is the user's
  action), OR
- `planning` (always movable — the planner advances one step toward `planned`).

(`planned`, `building`, `done`, `abandoned` are locked/terminal for planning and
do NOT make P-plan true.)

### P-implement — is there a DAG-ready task to implement?
TRUE iff there exists a **goal** G in `planned` or `building` that has a
**DAG-READY non-terminal task** — a task in the implement-flow READY-SET per
llm/commands/implement/advance.md §1: status non-terminal and NOT `blocked`; every
task in its `dependsOn` is `done`; its milestone's `dependsOn` milestones are
satisfied; and it has NO linked `open` question. (A goal whose only remaining
tasks are all `blocked` on open questions yields no ready task — P-implement is
FALSE for it.)

---

## The cycle (Q56 — loop to quiescence, NO max-iteration cap)

Repeat the following cycle. There is **NO fixed iteration cap** (Q56); the loop is
bounded by PROGRESS, not by a counter. Each stage runs its sub-command's own
internal loop (which is itself bounded by that command's stop predicates), then
you re-derive the predicates and continue.

### Cycle order: investigate → plan → implement, then RE-CHECK investigate
1. **Investigate stage.** Evaluate **P-investigate**. If TRUE, for each defect D in
   its worklist run **`/investigate:advance D` INLINE** — exactly per
   llm/commands/investigate/advance.md (do NOT re-implement it; RUN it). This
   triages only the NOT-owned-by-a-planning-goal defects (Q57); a defect already
   linked to a `clarifying`/`planning` goal is left for the plan stage's
   auto-investigate. If P-investigate is FALSE, skip this stage.
2. **Plan stage.** Evaluate **P-plan**. If TRUE, run **`/plan:advance` INLINE**
   (no argument — it advances every unlocked goal) exactly per
   llm/commands/plan/advance.md. Note: **plan:advance OWNS auto-investigate** of
   its goal-linked defects (its own auto-investigate phase) — so /advance does NOT
   double-triage them (Q57); the plan stage handles them as part of its own round.
   If P-plan is FALSE, skip this stage.
3. **Implement stage.** Evaluate **P-implement**. If TRUE, run
   **`/implement:advance` INLINE** (no argument) exactly per
   llm/commands/implement/advance.md. "Resume" INCLUDES a just-`planned` goal with
   no prior implement pass: `/implement:advance` derives its ready-set from the
   planned tasks (every non-archived, non-terminal milestone with non-terminal
   tasks), so a missing `/implement:start` or "no run bootstrapped yet" is NEVER a
   reason to skip the stage or to ask — bootstrap and build. Its reviewers may
   FILE new `open` defects (file-and-defer, K13). If P-implement is FALSE, skip
   this stage.
4. **RE-CHECK investigate after implement.** Because the implement reviewer may
   have filed new defects this cycle, re-evaluate **P-investigate** at the END of
   the cycle. If it is now TRUE again (new actionable defects appeared), the loop
   has made progress — continue to the next cycle (which will investigate them).

### Stop condition — quiescence (Q56)
Stop the loop ONLY when **progress is genuinely impossible** — that is, after a
full cycle in which **NO stage did any work AND no new actionable item appeared**.
Operationally, STOP when, at the end of a cycle, ALL hold:
- **P-investigate is FALSE** — every defect is terminal (`resolved`/`wontfix`),
  or owned by a planning goal (will be picked up by plan), or BLOCKED solely on an
  unanswered open question;
- **P-plan is FALSE** — no goal is in a movable planning phase (every unlocked
  goal is parked on open questions, or all goals are locked/terminal);
- **P-implement is FALSE** — no goal has a DAG-ready non-terminal task (every
  remaining task is terminal or blocked on an open question).

In other words: stop when **every ledger is DRAINED** (nothing actionable
anywhere) **OR every actionable item is BLOCKED on an unanswered user question**.

### The stop is PROGRESS-bounded, never EFFORT-bounded (hard gate)
A stop is legitimate ONLY when the predicates say so — never because the run has
cost effort. Before you may end a run you MUST do BOTH, in order:

1. **Re-derive and STATE the gate.** Emit the three predicates + the open-question
   gate from the ledger, explicitly: `P-investigate=… / P-plan=… / P-implement=…
   / open-Q-gate=…`. You may end ONLY if that line shows all three FALSE (DRAINED)
   or every still-TRUE predicate is gated solely by an unanswered `open` question
   (BLOCKED / MIXED). If any predicate is TRUE and nothing blocks it, you have NOT
   reached a legal stop — **CONTINUE**.
2. **Write the run-level `handoffs` record** (§Provenance / §End-of-run). This is
   the GATE: its only legal statuses are `drained` / `answers-required` / `mixed`
   / `illness-detected`, and each REQUIRES a specific predicate condition
   (`drained` needs all three predicates FALSE; `answers-required` / `mixed` need a
   non-empty `blockingQuestions[]`). There is deliberately **NO handoff status for
   an effort-based stop**, so such a stop has no legal terminal artifact.

**These are NOT stop conditions — NEVER end a run for any of them:**
- the turn or cycle is "long", or has run for many steps;
- token / compute cost, or the number of subagents dispatched;
- "a natural stopping point" / "a substantial milestone has been reached";
- "substantial work has already landed this run";
- the remaining work feels disproportionate to its value (e.g. the full
  investigate→plan→implement ceremony for a confirmed one-line fix) — proportion
  is not a stop condition; continue and finish it;
- the next stage is large, consequential, or high-blast-radius (e.g. a
  multi-task, multi-language implementation, or autonomously building an entire
  feature) — magnitude is NEVER a reason to pause or confirm;
- no implement run has been bootstrapped yet — P-implement TRUE on a `planned`
  goal means BOOTSTRAP and build it, not ask (see the implement stage above).

**Default disposition for every defect is FIX (hard rule).** Every
`open`/`wip`/`root-caused`/`inconclusive` defect is fixed, properly, now. The
flow NEVER asks whether to fix a confirmed/known defect — it drives it
investigate → plan → implement autonomously to resolution. `wontfix` is a
**user-INITIATED decision only**: the autonomous flow never transitions a defect
to `wontfix` and never solicits that disposition. "Out of scope", "pre-existing",
"changes a versioned/external/public API", "wide blast radius", and
magnitude/proportion/cost are NOT reasons to defer-to-the-user — they are
reasons to file a fix task and continue. A defect tagged by a reviewer as a
"candidate for a separate fix" means *fix it in a separate task*, never *ask
whether to fix it*.

**No confirmation pauses, and the ban is on CONTENT not just channel (hard
rule).** `/advance` NEVER uses `AskUserQuestion` — or any inline "should I
proceed / is this OK / confirm the scope" prompt — to pause between stages. The
ONLY legitimate user-facing pause is **BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS**: an `open`
`questions` item whose answer changes **WHAT to build or HOW the system must
behave** (a genuine requirements ambiguity), OR that unblocks
otherwise-impossible work (a reproduction that cannot be produced from the repo,
or missing external access/credentials). Filing a `questions` item does NOT
launder a forbidden confirmation into a "legitimate" stop: a question that asks
**fix-vs-wontfix, whether-to-fix, out-of-scope/pre-existing handling,
external/public-API or blast-radius disposition, or scope/scale/magnitude** is
the SAME forbidden confirmation as `AskUserQuestion` — do NOT file it, do NOT
stop on it; **CONTINUE and fix**. The rule bans the *content* (a
disposition/confirmation question), regardless of the *channel* used to raise
it. If you are tempted to ask one, that is the signal to **CONTINUE**.

**Running `/advance` is the authorization.** It overrides any standing
"confirm hard-to-reverse / outward-facing changes" or "ask when instructions are
unclear" default (including the user's global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
caution-first guidance) **for the disposition of confirmed defects and for
scope/blast-radius of a fix**: a generated/external-API change is still fixed
without confirmation. Those cautious-confirm defaults apply only to a genuine
*requirements* ambiguity (WHAT/HOW the system must behave), never to whether or
how thoroughly to fix a confirmed fault. The user chose to launch `/advance`;
that is the standing go-ahead to fix everything.

If you find yourself reaching for any of the above, that is the signal to
**CONTINUE**, not to classify. Keep cycling while ANY stage still moves the
ledger forward. A cycle that made progress (any stage acted, or re-check (4)
surfaced new work) means another cycle is warranted.

---

## Milestone auto-close + archive sweep (end-of-run — placeholder, T128)

After the loop reaches quiescence, run the **auto-close+archive sweep** over the
entire `milestones` ledger. `/advance` is the AUTHORITATIVE locus for this rule
(it re-derives ledger state each run, so it also catches milestones whose goal
the user closed between runs); implement/advance.md's milestone-completion step
states the SAME factored predicate for the in-pass case — keep the two in sync,
do not let them diverge.

A milestone `M` is **eligible to auto-close+archive** iff BOTH:
1. **every item under `M`** (across ALL ledgers — tasks, defects, reviews,
   questions, decisions, hypotheses, and the goal item if any) is **terminal**; AND
2. if `M` is a **coordination milestone** (its items include a `goals` item),
   that **goal is itself terminal** (`done`/`abandoned`). A **work** milestone
   has no goal item, so condition 2 is vacuous for it.

**Mechanism (both hold):** `update_milestone(M, status: "done")` THEN
`archive_milestone(M)` — `archive_milestone` refuses unless the milestone-item is
already terminal, so the `done` step comes first. No `dependsOn`-terminal
precondition beyond the two above.

**Guard:** NEVER archive a coordination milestone whose goal is **non-terminal**,
even when all its current items are terminal — pending follow-up scope may still
add items (a goal in `planned`/`building`, or re-opened to `clarifying`, keeps
its coordination milestone open).

**Goal-vs-milestone asymmetry (explicit):** **GOALS NEVER auto-close** — never
transition a goal `building`→`done` (always the user's action; the G3-B / M16
invariant). **MILESTONES ALWAYS may** auto-close+archive once eligible. So once
the user closes a goal `G`, the next `/advance` sweep archives `G`'s
now-eligible coordination milestone automatically.

## End-of-run report (Q59 — DRAINED / BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS / MIXED)

When the loop stops, classify the run into exactly ONE of three categories and
report it. Mirror llm/commands/implement/advance.md's end-of-pass report style
(concise, id-listing, next-action-bearing).

- **DRAINED** — nothing actionable remains anywhere: every defect terminal or
  plan-owned, every goal locked/terminal for planning, every task terminal, and
  NO actionable item is blocked on an open question. Report: the work that landed
  across the run (defects root-caused/resolved, goals planned, tasks merged,
  milestones archived), and that the run is complete — no user action needed.
- **BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS** — progress stopped ONLY because actionable items are
  parked on unanswered `open` questions. **Enumerate every blocking question** by
  id, each with its OWNING item (the `defects:<D>` / `goals:<G>` / `tasks:<id>` it
  ledgerRefs) and a one-line summary. Instruct the user: **answer the listed
  questions in the TUI/web, then re-run `/advance`** to resume (the loop folds the
  answers back in and continues).
- **MIXED** — progress was made this run AND some actionable items remain blocked
  on open questions. Report BOTH: (a) what landed (as in DRAINED), and (b) the
  remaining blocking question ids with owning items (as in BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS).
  Next action: answer the listed questions, then re-run `/advance`.

To build the report, re-derive the three predicates one final time from the
ledger: if all three are FALSE and no `open` question gates any actionable item →
**DRAINED**; if the only thing standing between an item and progress is an
unanswered question → **BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS** (or **MIXED** when the run also
landed work). Always close with the concrete next action and (for the blocked
categories) the exact list of question ids to answer.

After emitting the report, persist it as the single run-level `handoffs` record
— `/advance`'s one and only ledger write — mapping this classification to the
handoff `status` (DRAINED→`drained`, BLOCKED-ON-QUESTIONS→`answers-required`,
MIXED→`mixed`, error/abort→`illness-detected`) and populating `summary`, `flow`,
`ledgerRefs`, `blockingQuestions`, `handoffReasons` (for `mixed`), and
`sessionLogs` in that one `create_item`. See §Provenance for the full item shape.
