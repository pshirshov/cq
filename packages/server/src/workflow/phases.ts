/**
 * phases.ts — the phase-subagent dispatch seam (cycle 3) and the structured
 * output schemas for each `/plan` loop phase.
 *
 * Every phase (producer, clarify-reviewer, planner, plan-reviewer) is a
 * HEADLESS subagent that returns a Zod-validated structured payload via a
 * harness-owned in-process `submit_*` MCP tool. The subagent NEVER writes
 * ledgers; the WorkflowRuntime (HARNESS) does. This is the same mechanism the
 * phase-1 producer uses, lifted to a generic `PhaseSubagent` so the loop logic
 * does not branch on backend and the Codex relay variant (next cycle) slots in
 * without reworking the loops.
 *
 * A `PhaseSpec<O>` couples a submit-tool name, its Zod schema, and a
 * prompt-builder. A `PhaseSubagent` dispatches a spec + a request and resolves
 * with the validated output. `ClaudePhaseSubagent` (claudePhaseSubagent.ts) is
 * the Claude implementation; a Codex variant is a documented stub.
